This script successfully automates the scraping of earnings call transcripts from multiple investor relations (IR) websites. Its design and logic are sound: it correctly handles HTML and PDF transcript extraction, organizes output by company, and maintains a rolling four-quarter window.

However, two external factors limit performance:

Bot Protection (403/304 errors): Many Investor Relations portals block automated requests via Cloudflare or similar systems. This is not a code issue but a server-side restriction.

PDF Format Issues: Some companies (e.g., Adobe) publish transcripts as image-only or protected PDFs without machine-readable text layers. Libraries like pdfplumber and PyPDF2 can’t extract readable text from these, resulting in encoded or blank .txt files.

The script would function as intended if those external barriers didn’t exist.
To improve robustness, future updates could include:

User-agent and proxy rotation to reduce blocking.

OCR fallback (via Tesseract) for image-based PDFs.

Optional company-specific parsing for sites with unique layouts.
