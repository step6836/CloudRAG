Operator
Good day, everyone. Welcome to Salesforce Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Results Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this call is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mike Spencer, Executive Vice President of
Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Michael Spencer
Executive Vice President of Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2025 fourth quarter results conference call.
Our press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our website.
Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, President and Chief Financial
Officer; Brian Millham, President and Chief Operating Officer. In addition, we also have Robin Washington,
our Board member and incoming Chief Operating and Finance Officer here with us today.
As a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP
and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release.
Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our
assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that
could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report in Forms
10-K, 10-Q and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to
update these forward-looking statements.
And with that, let me hand the call to Marc.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, thanks so much, Mike. And I'm so excited about this call and reading the script with you because this
was just the best quarter we've ever had. And I think you're going to see that as we kind of unfold what's
happening here. I'm sitting here with Amy and Brian and Mike, and Sabastian is also on the table; and at
our new COFO, Robin Washington, is here. So welcome, Robin. We're thrilled to have you here as well.
And look, I'm really excited about this. I really think that we have something incredible to talk about. And
obviously, this was the order of Agentforce, we're going to talk about that, but it was really just another
incredible quarter. And really, it's been another incredible year of growth in innovation.
I'm sure you all can see we've had a really strong performance across all of our key metrics: on revenue,
on margin, EPS, cash flow, CRPO. We've passed some amazing milestones, including more than $60 billion
in RPO, and this has been the highest cash flow in our company history. You can see we exceeded our
cash flow guidance. I think Amy did about $12.9 billion last quarter, but I think we delivered $13.1-ish
billion and that was just incredible for the quarter. And now we're giving guidance. I think it's around
$14.5 billion in guidance for next year on the cash flow guidance. So just awesome cash production. Few
enterprise software companies have really ever delivered these kind of numbers. And I guess, only a
couple have ever delivered guidance in the $40 billion, which is where we are.
And our 2 newest major products, our Data Cloud and Agentforce, our AI product line now, we can see
as a multibillion-dollar product line. So we're excited to be in that kind of rarefied area of delivering a
multibillion-dollar AI product line.

We ended this year with $900 million in Data Cloud and AI ARR. It grew 120% year-over-year. We've
never seen products grow at these levels, especially Agentforce. And Data Cloud and AI, Agentforce, this
is now going to be incredible coming into fiscal year '26.
As we begin this year, and well, since our founding, I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead. This
is a moment like we've just never seen before. And in just a few months, we've seen this addressable
market go from hundreds of billions of dollars.
And I'm sure you saw those ARK slides that got released over the weekend where she said that she
thought this digital labor revolution, which is really like kind of what we're in here now, this digital labor
revolution, this looks like it's anywhere from a few trillion to $12 trillion. I mean, I kind of agree with her.
I think this is much, much bigger than software. I mean, for the last 25 years, we've been doing software
to help our customers manage their data. That's very exciting. I think building software that kind of prints
and deploys digital workers is more exciting, and you're going to hear some of these incredible stories in a
second.
Our formula now really for our customers is this idea that we have these incredible Customer 360 apps.
We have this incredible Data Cloud, and this incredible agentic platform. These are the 3 layers. But
that it is a deeply unified platform, it's a deeply unified platform, it's just one piece of code, that's what
makes it so unique in this market. And that is why customers are having so great success with it. It's not
a collection of disjointed parts you have to kind of self-assemble, DIY it, all kinds of how do you get the
security running, how do you do this, how do you do that. It's this idea that it's a deeply unified platform
with one piece of code all wrapped in a beautiful layer of trust. And that's what gives Agentforce this
incredible accuracy that we're seeing. I'm going to talk about even what we've seen at Salesforce with
that is amazing.
And I'll tell you that our customers are just seeing some great success with it. And that's why just 90
days after it went live, we've already had 3,000 paying Agentforce customers who are experiencing
unprecedented levels of productivity, efficiency and cost and cost savings.
No one else is delivering at this level of capability. And we're really seeing a level of integration, simplicity,
intelligence, power. I mean, customers are really telling us that we're light years ahead of other providers
and their feedback really speaks volumes. So excited to go on the web and see Agentforce delivering labor
for companies like Equinox, OpenTable, Jacuzzi and others. I mean I go to their sites, I'm going to their X
feeds, their social media presence, and you see Agentforce running. And look, a lot of other vendors are
talking about their agent capabilities, but few are able to show that they've got this really running at scale.
And as you're about to hear from Brian, we're seeing some amazing results on Salesforce as Customer
Zero for Agentforce. Our digital labor force is resolving tens of thousands of customer service inquiries,
freeing our human employees to focus on the most nuanced issues and customer relationships. We're
seeing tremendous momentum and success stories emerge as we execute our vision to make every
company, every single company, every customer of ours, an Agentforce company, that is, we want every
customer to be an Agentforce customer. We want every Trailblazer to be an Agentblazer. And I want
to share some of these amazing stories with you today. But first, let's hit a couple of these incredible
numbers.
We closed out fiscal year '25 with $10 billion in revenue, that's amazing, our first $10 billion quarter. I
remember we had our first $10 billion a year. Kind of amazing, $10 billion a quarter, up 8% year-overyear, 9% in constant currency. And I think we even lost, Amy, is that right, like a couple of hundred million
dollars in foreign exchange for the year as well. In Q4, we closed more than 400 deals over $1 million. All
of our top 10 wins included data and AI. Brian, 400 deals over $1 million, pretty awesome. And we also
continued phenomenal growth with Data Cloud this year, which is the heart of Agentforce.
Data Cloud is the fuel that powers Agentforce and our customers are investing in it. And Data Cloud
surpassed 50 trillion, that's trillion with a T, records, doubling year-over-year as customers increase their
consumption investment in our data platform. And that is just becoming a critical and essential part of our
solution because as customers turn on AI and Agentforce, if they don't have the data, we've been talking
about this, I guess, for almost 2 years, if you don't have the data, you're not going to get the AI that you
SALESFORCE, INC. FQ4 2025 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 26, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6
so badly want. And nearly 25% of those 50 trillion records, that was trillion with a T, were ingested from
outside of Salesforce through our Zero Copy partner network, which is amazing.
We'll see increased investments in software to build an agentic layer as AI continues to advance and
handle a higher percentage of workloads, and we're taking advantage of the huge investments that these
infrastructure companies, we just -- you know we'll work with. Of course, we have 2 substrates live, where
we have Amazon and we have Alibaba. Both companies are making huge investments in infrastructure.
And the third one, Google, is making a huge infrastructure investment. We're really getting great prices
from these companies. And our deployment, our ability to deploy, at a really low cost is just awesome, and
it's just driving down our cost for our customers. So that's so exciting.
Look, for the full year, we delivered $37.9 billion in revenue. It's up 9% year-over-year. Operating cash
flow reaching $13.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year. It's really one of the best performances, I think, of
any software company. And with our continued disciplined approach to margin expansion, our non-GAAP
operating margin closed at 33%. That was 250 basis points for fiscal year '25. I think it's 50 basis points
higher than we even gave you guidance for a year ago. Is that right, Amy? Yes. And that's awesome. But
we also passed an incredible milestones with more than $60 billion in RPO. That, I don't think we could
have expected.
So this milestone isn't just a number, it's a clear signal that our customers are trusting us, deploying us,
getting great value from us, and continuing to invest in our vision for digital labor. I mean I think it's going
to be that digital labor vision, that revelation that we're able to provide, digital labor at scale with this
trinity of apps, data and agents that is going to drive this fiscal year '26 success.
We expect to deliver fiscal year '26 subscription and support revenue of 9% year-over-year in constant
currency. We remain deeply, deeply committed to profitable growth and expect fiscal year '26 non-GAAP
operating margin of 34%. We're going to deliver another 100 basis points of expansion, following 2
years where we expanded more than 1,000 basis points. The pace of change, the focus on productivity,
profitability, the speed of innovation, the trinity of apps, data and agents, it's all coming together.
As I mentioned, we're seeing customers deploy Agentforce across every industry. Let's talk about a couple
of examples. We've been working with Lennar, the nation's largest homebuilder. And most of you know
Lennar is really an incredible company, and they've been a customer of ours for about 8 years. They came
to Dreamforce. And when they came to Dreamforce, they obviously got their hands like many of you did
on Agentforce, got super excited, went back to Miami, talked to their co-CEOs.
You probably know Stuart Miller, Jon Jaffe, amazing CEOs. And those co-CEOs called me and said,
"Listen, these guys have done a hackathon around Agentforce. We've got 5 use cases. We see incredible
opportunities on our margin, incredible opportunities in our revenue. And do you have our back if we're
going to deploy this?" And we said, "Absolutely. We've deployed it ourselves," which is the best evidence
that this is real. And they are just incredible, their vision as a homebuilder providing 24/7 support, sales
leads through all their digital channels. They're able to sell all kinds of new products. I think they're going
to sell mortgages and insurance and all kinds of things to their customers. And the cool thing is they're
using our sales product, our service product, marketing, MuleSoft, Slack, Tableau, they use everything.
But they are able to leverage it all together by realizing that just by turning it on, they get this incredible
Agentforce capability.
All right. I want to tell you another story, not just about Lennar and transforming a homebuilder, but
I don't know how many of you know about Pandora. If you've been to a shopping center, you will see
the Pandora store. You walk in, they have this gorgeous jewelry. They have these cool charm bracelets.
They have amazing products. And if you know their CEO, Alex, he's absolutely phenomenal. I think
he's based over in Amsterdam or he's in the Netherlands. I can't remember where it is, but one of the
Northern European countries. Incredible CEO, Time actually just gave them an award as one of the most
sustainable companies in the world, a great company. They're in 100 countries. They employ 37,000
people worldwide.
And Alex has this great vision to augment their employees with digital labor. And this idea that whether
you're on their website or in their store, or whatever it is, that they're going to be able to do so much
SALESFORCE, INC. FQ4 2025 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 26, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
more with Agentforce. They already use -- first of all, they already use Commerce Cloud. So if you've been
to pandora.com and bought their products -- and if you have it, by the way, it's completely worthwhile.
It's great. And you can experience our Commerce Cloud, but it's deeply integrated with our Service Cloud,
with Data Cloud. It's the one unified platform approach. And now they're just flipping the switch, turning
agents on, and they're planning to deliver 30% to 60% of their service cases with Agentforce. That is
awesome. And I really love Alex's vision of what's possible.
And then the last customer I really want to hit on, which I'm so excited about, is Pfizer. And Albert is an
incredible CEO. They are doing unbelievable things. They've been a tremendous customer. But now they're
really going all in on our Life Sciences Cloud. We're seeing so many -- I was in the Business Council last
week in Washington, D.C., met with hundreds of CEOs. And so many of the CEOs of the life sciences
industry are going with our Life Sciences Cloud. It was incredible. And you can see why because it's just a
natural upgrade of what they're already doing with us.
And then this idea that our Life Sciences Cloud becomes this highly differentiated capability from
everything currently available in the market, that allows these pharma, medtech companies, so many,
to be able to streamline not just their clinical operations, all their customer-facing, even the ones who
want to go to direct-to-consumer, even the ones who want to do clinical trials, and this idea that agents
are going to make all of that so much better. And with Agentforce, sales agents, for example, with Pfizer,
that's -- they've got 20,000 customer-facing employees and customer-facing folks. That is just a radical
extension for them with agents.
And I'll have to slide in one last one because I'll tell you, I'm sure a lot of you -- like, I have flown in
Singapore Air. You know what? It's a great airline. The CEO, Goh, is amazing. And he has a huge vision
that also came out of Dreamforce, where they've already delivered probably the best service of any airline
in the world; they want to deliver it through agents. So whether you're doing it with service or sales or
marketing or commerce or all the different things that Singapore Air is doing with us, you're going to be
able to do this right on Singapore Air.
All right. Well, I know all of you want to see this in person, talk to these customers yourself. You can go
to help.salesforce.com. Brian is going to talk about that. When you hear the numbers we delivered in the
quarter there, you're not going to believe it.
And listen, a lot of people say to me, "Hey, how are you different from these other agent companies?"
Number one, go to those other vendors. Go to their sites. Are they running their agent technology? You've
all been on help.salesforce.com. You all know this incredible capability that we're delivering. You've seen it
deployed by these other customers like Equinox and Remarkable and others. You've got your hands on --
do you see the other scaled vendors delivering this capability? Or are they just using the word "agent"?
I think you got to be aware of the false agent because the false agent is out there where people can use
the word agent or they kind of -- they're trying to whitewash all the agent, the thing, everywhere. But the
reality is there is the real agents and there are the false agents, and we're very fortunate to have the real
stuff going on here. So we've got a lot more groundbreaking AI innovation coming. I can't wait for you
to see it at our TrailheadDX event next week. And that's going to be March 5 and 6 in San Francisco. I'm
looking forward to seeing all of you there and showing you that.
And I'll tell you, while you're there, I didn't hit it, you've got to see this new product we've just built,
which is Tableau Next. I'm sure a lot of you know Tableau. You probably use it every day. When you see
what we have built, which is the new Tableau built with Agentforce on the Data Cloud, and how it's deeply
integrated into our product line, it is going to blow your mind. It is incredible. You've got to make sure
you get a demo of Tableau Next. You won't believe it. You're going to see the new Slack. You're going to
see the new Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, the platform, Agentforce, all
the products; the new field service product, which is incredible. You might get a glimpse of the new ITSM
product that's coming if you look hard. But the big thing that I'm excited about, okay, the big thing that
I'm really excited about, is Tableau Next because that's about to deploy to customers at scale, and I think
people are going to be absolutely blown away.

All right. Now before I do that, I have to get out the Kleenex because I have to say goodbye to Brian and
Amy who, it's kind of a moment in time here where Brian has been here for, I think, 25 years, 26 years.
He's just wearing one of the many watches that I've given him to recognize his performance. Amy is here
as well. She's not wearing one of her watches, but she has them at home, probably in her jewelry case or
safe or something. And how long has it been, Amy? 12 years? 11 years with Amy, and we're going through
a little bit of a transition of our management team between fiscal year '25 and '26. And we want to say
goodbye, and thank you.
We want to say [Foreign Language], and we want to say goodbye, which is [Foreign Language]. And thank
you so much for everything, and we're going to let them talk and also say their goodbyes, but we're so
grateful to everything that you've done for us every single day over the last 25 and 11 years. And it's been
great to have you part of our management team. And you're welcome back any time. So if you get lonely
out there on the golf course, or I know Amy's got some big plans that she's not ready to announce yet in
the NGO world, but I'll tell you that if you guys get lonely or you're missing the thrill of the hunt, come
back and see us because we're going to be ready for you to come back.
Okay. All right, Brian.
Brian Millham
President & COO
I really appreciate it. It's been a privilege of a lifetime to work here for more than 25 years. Very few
people get to start at a company that has 0 revenue and help it grow to $38 billion. The journey has been
remarkable, and this year was certainly the capstone.
As you heard from Marc, in just 1 quarter, Agentforce has been deployed by thousands of brands
worldwide, becoming an incredible lever for productivity, growth and efficiency. It's happened faster than
we ever expected. With our deeply unified platform seamlessly integrating our Customer 360 apps, Data
Cloud and Agentforce, we're leading the digital labor revolution. Customers of every size across every
industry are seeing immediate and substantial value with Agentforce.
We're setting new standards in the industry. OpenTable is a great example of how Agentforce is having an
immediate impact. In just 3 weeks, it's handling 73% of all restaurant web queries, a 50% improvement
over their previous tool. And they're not alone. The Futurum Group surveyed customers and found that
Agentforce can achieve ROI 5x faster than DIY while lowering costs by 20%. And technology analyst
firm Valoir found Agentforce delivers autonomous AI agents 16x faster versus DIY approaches with 75%
increased accuracy. We continue to see significant increase in large multi-cloud transactions as companies
look to accelerate faster time to value, efficiency and growth.
Goodyear is partnering with us on their transformation, using Agentforce to automate and increase
the effectiveness of their sales efforts. With Agentforce for Field Service, Goodyear will be able to
reduce repair time by assisting technicians with answers to vehicle-related questions and autonomously
scheduling field test appointments.
We also continue to embed an agentic layer across our own business. Today, we're live on Agentforce
across service and sales, our business technology organization, customer support and more. And the
results are phenomenal. Since launching on our Salesforce help portal in October, Agentforce has
autonomously handled 380,000 service requests, achieving an incredible 84% resolution rate and only 2%
of the requests require human escalation.
And we're using Agentforce for quoting, accelerating our quoting cycles by more than 75%. In Q4, we
increased our AE capacity while still driving productivity up 7% year-over-year. Agentforce is transforming
how we do outbound prospecting, already engaging more than 50 leads per day with personalized
outreach and timely follow-ups, freeing up our teams to focus on high-value conversation. Our reps are
participating in thousands of sales coaching training sessions each month.
Data Cloud has a powerful network effect. As usage expands, the platform becomes more intelligent
and more valuable. And that's why we're seeing companies around the world, including Maserati, Bell
Canada, Dolce & Gabbana continue to invest in Data Cloud and to build the foundation to implement

agents at scale. CaixaBank, which happens to be Spain's leading bank, is using Data Cloud to create a
robust data infrastructure that supports its agentic transformation and enables them to drive faster and
more consistent customer experiences.
As you know, the true value of AI is in the data. Nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI and Data Cloud
customers, and all of our top 10 wins in Q4 included Data Cloud and AI. Agentforce is revolutionizing how
our customers work by bringing AI-powered insights and actions directly into the workflows across the
Customer 360 applications. This is driving strong growth across our portfolio. Sales Cloud and Service
Cloud both achieved double-digit (sic) [ new bookings ] growth again in Q4. We're seeing fantastic
momentum with Slack, with customers like ZoomInfo, Remarkable and MIMIT Health using Agentforce and
Slack to boost productivity.
Once again, Slack was included in over 1/3 of our deals over $1 million, and its contribution to the overall
deal size increased double digits year-over-year. With nearly 5 billion messages sent weekly, Slack is
central to how people work. Going forward, we're confident Slack will be the place where every company
brings digital labor to all of their employees, enabling collaboration with Agentforce to get work done.
Tableau and MuleSoft are mission-critical to our customers with each featured in nearly half of our greater
than $1 million deals. Tableau, now integrated with Data Cloud and Agentforce on the Salesforce core
platform, will transform how customers like EchoStar, Goosehead Insurance and Keller Williams Realty
take action on their data. Customers can now unlock actionable insights from conversational analytics,
manage and analyze data using AI assistants and build analytical agents with integrated workflows.
Similarly, MuleSoft is transforming how industry leaders like Banco Bradesco, Fujitsu and Sony Honda
Mobility approach enterprise integration. With agent-driven integration and out-of-the-box connectors for
every major system, customers simply describe their needs in natural language and our AI automatically
builds the solution.
Agentforce is also enabling us to deliver truly transformative solutions for every industry and region.
In Q4, nearly half of our top 100 wins were international, including wins with companies like One New
Zealand, LG Electronics and Versace. Our industry business, along with public sector and .org, finished the
year at an incredible $5.7 billion in ARR, up 20% year-over-year. All of our top 10 deals and nearly 75%
of our top 100 deals included the industry cloud. To meet this demand, we've prebuilt over 170 specialized
Agentforce industry skills and a team of 400 specialists, supporting transformations across sectors and
geographies.
Our new channels and partner ecosystem, anchored by our amazing 19 million Trailblazers are unlocking
customer spend and driving Agentforce adoption. And we're leaning into our ecosystem. In fact, partners
were involved in 50% of our Agentforce wins and 70% of our Agentforce activations in Q4. We're also
working with our partners to become Agentforce companies themselves. Accenture is using Agentforce
Sales Coach, which provides personalized coaching and recommendations for sales teams, which is
expected to lead to higher win rates. And Deloitte is projecting significant productivity gains and saved
workforce hours as they roll out Agentforce over the next few years.
Over 127,000 system integrated employees have completed Agentforce training, and more than 1,000
ISVs and technology partners are building and selling agents. Our Agentforce partner network allows
customers to deploy prebuilt agents and use agent actions through partners like AWS, Google, IBM,
Workday and more. Earlier this week, we announced expanded partnership with Google that Marc
mentioned to empower customers to use Agentforce with Gemini, their multimodal model and to deploy
Salesforce on Google Cloud. AWS is a huge growth engine for us, helping us close a number of large deals.
In fact, in Q4, we closed 25 transactions over $1 million, including 3 that were more than $10 million.
We're starting off FY '26 in an incredible position, with a highly accomplished and technical leadership
team ready to guide us through this pivotal moment in AI and agents. I'm incredibly grateful for the
opportunity and to all the leaders who have gotten us here, especially Marc and Amy. It's been an honor to
work alongside both of you. Thank you to our employees, customers, partners and shareholders. I couldn't
be more proud of what we've accomplished or more excited about what's ahead for Salesforce.

And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy.
Amy E. Weaver
President & CFO
Great. Thanks, Brian. I wanted to start also by expressing my gratitude to Marc and Brian for their
partnership and for their deep friendship over many, many years. It's been an incredible journey, and I'm
truly thankful for the opportunity. I am also absolutely thrilled to welcome Robin to the team as our new
Chief Operating and Financial Officer.
Fiscal year '25 was a year of incredible change with new innovation beyond anything we could have
expected just 12 months ago, requiring persistence and urgency in our execution. Q4 is a reflection of that
focus across the business, and you can see it in our results.
Let's start with revenue. For the full year, revenue was $37.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year in both
nominal and constant currency. Subscription and support revenue grew just over 10% in constant
currency. Q4 revenue was $10 billion, up 8% year-over-year and nominal. This includes approximately
$75 million of incremental FX headwinds since our last guidance, resulting in 9% growth year-over-year
in constant currency. Subscription and support revenue grew 9% year-over-year in constant driven by
stability in sales, service and platform, partially offset by MuleSoft and Tableau, who had very tough prioryear compares.
From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue grew 8% in nominal and constant currency, EMEA grew
6% or 7% in constant currency, and APAC grew 10% or 14% in constant currency. We saw strong new
business growth in Lat Am, Japan and Canada, while parts of EMEA remain constrained. Of note, the
United States saw some stabilization in the quarter.
From an industry perspective, in Q4, health and life sciences, communications and media both performed
well, while tech and manufacturing, automotive and energy were more measured. And as you heard from
Brian, our multi-cloud momentum continues as customers turn to our deeply unified platform. That's why
our top 100 deals in the quarter averaged 6 clouds, and all of our top 10 wins included AI, Data Cloud,
service platform and industry clouds.
Our data and AI momentum continues as we move towards a world where AI is ubiquitous and embedded
in everyday workflows, our investments in this space have been deliberate and focused, and we are
now starting to yield strong returns. We ended the year with $900 million in Data Cloud and AI annual
recurring revenue, growing nearly 120% year-over-year.
As Marc shared, we closed more than 3,000 paid Agentforce deals in the quarter. As customers continue
to harness the value of AI deeply embedded across our unified platform, it is no surprise that these
customers average nearly 4 clouds. And these customers came from a diverse set of industries with more
than half in technology, manufacturing, financial services and HLS. Q4 revenue attrition ended the quarter
slightly above 8%, in line with recent quarters.
Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by top line
outperformance and disciplined expense management. GAAP operating margin was 18.2%, up 70 basis
points year-over-year. And for the full year, I am very pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin of
33%, up another 250 basis points year-over-year. GAAP operating margin was 19%, up 460 basis points
year-over-year, inclusive of incremental restructuring charges we incurred in Q4.
Q4 operating cash flow was nearly $4 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Q4 free cash flow was $3.8 billion,
also up 17% year-over-year. And for the full year, operating cash flow was a record $13.1 billion, up 28%
year-over-year, and that's inclusive of a predicted 10-point cash tax headwind. And as we've said, driving
strong free cash flow remains a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Fiscal year '25 free cash
flow was $12.4 billion, up 31% year-over-year.
Turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract.
We passed $60 billion for the first time in company history. Q4 finished at an incredible $63.4 billion, up
11% year-over-year, representing our customers' long-term commitment to Salesforce and the durability

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
of our business model. Current RPO, or cRPO, ended at $30.2 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year
in nominal currency. This includes a $300 million FX headwind, which results in an 11% year-over-year
growth in constant currency, driven by strong performance in Data Cloud and AI and Slack. Q4 cRPO also
benefited significantly from strong early renewals.
Within our bookings this quarter, we again saw continued stabilization in our transactional businesses,
including create-and-close and SMB.
On capital return, in fiscal '25, we executed $7.8 billion in share repurchases and issued $1.5 billion in
dividends. Through our capital return program, we more than fully offset dilution from FY '25 stock-based
compensation. And since the inception of our capital return program, we have now returned more than
$21 billion to shareholders.
Now let's turn to guidance. Starting with full fiscal year '26. We expect revenue of $40.5 billion to $40.9
billion, growth of approximately 7% to 8% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency. And for
subscription and support revenue, we expect growth of approximately 9% year-over-year in constant
currency.
Now I want to pause and give a few important notes on this guidance. First, on foreign exchange, as Marc
noted, we've seen the U.S. dollar strengthen considerably. And even since our last earnings call, that
movement has driven an incremental $200 million headwind to fiscal '26 revenue. Our revenue guidance
now incorporates an approximately 0.5 point year-over-year headwind.
Second, as we experienced in fiscal '25, we continue to expect our professional services business to be a
headwind to growth this year, which is reflected in our guidance for total revenue. Note that as part of our
overall implementation strategy, we are leaning more on our partner ecosystem. As you heard from Brian,
partners were involved in 50% of our Agentforce wins and 70% of Agentforce activations in Q4.
Third, we expect subscription and support revenue to be lifted by momentum in Data Cloud and some
contribution from Agentforce this year, partially offset by weakness in marketing and commerce and
slower growth in our expiration base in FY '26.
Finally, on Agentforce, we are incredibly excited about the customer momentum we are seeing. However,
the adoption cycle is still early as we focus on deployment with our customers. As a result, we are
assuming a modest contribution to revenue in fiscal '26. We expect the momentum to build throughout the
year, driving a more meaningful contribution in fiscal '27. And on attrition, we expect attrition to remain
consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year.
Now turning to profitability and cash flow. On margins, I want to reiterate that the company remains
committed to ongoing expansion. The company has laid a strong foundation for continued margin
progression, efficiency and disciplined investments. Fiscal year '26 non-GAAP operating margin is
expected to be 34%, representing another 100 basis points of expansion year-over-year. This incorporates
intentional investments in high-growth opportunities, most notably in Agentforce and Data Cloud. And I'd
like to call out that from a pace perspective, we do expect a ramp in margins throughout the year.
Stock-based compensation is expected to stay relatively flat year-over-year as a percent of revenue.
We expect fiscal year '26 GAAP operating margin of 21.6%, representing more than 250 basis points of
improvement year-over-year. We expect fiscal year '26 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.95 to $7.03. Non-GAAP
diluted EPS is expected to be $11.09 to $11.17.
As we have mentioned over the last few years, we remain focused on driving durable cash flow growth.
We expect fiscal year '26 operating cash flow growth of approximately 10% to 11%, and we are not
expecting a material headwind from cash taxes this year. We expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be
approximately 2% of revenue again. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 9% to 10% for
the fiscal year.
Now to guidance for Q1. On revenue, we expect $9.71 billion to $9.76 billion, up 6% to 7% year-over-year
in nominal, and 7% in constant currency. As a reminder, we are lapping the 1-point leap year benefit we
noted last Q1 as well as the benefit from license revenue timing.

cRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be approximately 10% year-over-year in nominal, including a $100
million FX headwind, resulting in slightly above 10% in constant currency. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of
$1.49 to $1.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.53 to $2.55.
In closing, I'm very pleased with our strong finish to the year and the foundation we have set in place for
continued success. And I want to thank our employees for their dedication and execution throughout the
year. I also want to extend my gratitude to our shareholder and investment community for your continued
support. It has really been a privilege working with all of you.

Question and Answer
Operator
And the first question today comes from Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Congratulations on a really strong end to FY '25. I wanted to dig into the Agentforce opportunity, some
really big numbers there in terms of the number of deals signed and real good revenue momentum there.
Investors are asking me a lot and have a lot of questions on how the pricing model looks.
Michael Spencer
Executive Vice President of Investor Relations
Keith, sorry, the first part of your question...
Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Can you hear me?
Michael Spencer
Executive Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes, I can hear you now. The first part of your question cut out. So could you start over, please?
Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Perfect. So congratulations on a very strong quarter. A lot of focus on Agentforce and a lot of big numbers
there. Investors are asking me a lot of questions about the changing pricing model dynamics going from
a seat-based model to one that includes consumptive elements and how that nets out. So I was hoping
you could give us some color in terms of what you guys are seeing thus far when you're doing these
Agentforce contracts. Is it expanding the overall contract size? What kind of expansions are you seeing if
you are seeing expansions? And does the math net to be a good positive for Salesforce as we move to a
more consumptive model? Or are there any bumps in the road that we should be aware of?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Okay. Well, I'd love to address that directly, and then I'm going to ask Brian to come in with some
specifics and examples because I think it's so exciting. I think, of course, we've kind of started the
company out with the per user pricing model, and that's about humans. We price per human, so you're
kind of pricing per human. And then we have products, though, that are also in the consumption world
as well. And of course, those started in the early days, things like our sandboxes, even things like our
Commerce Cloud, even our e-mail marketing product, our Marketing Cloud. These are consumption-based
products we've had for years. And it's always been a mix of products that we have for humans and then
products that we have for computers.
Now we have these kind of products that are for agents also, and agents are also a consumption
model. So when we look at our Data Cloud, for example, that's a consumption product. Agentforce is a
consumption product. But it's going to be a mix. It's going to be a mix between what's going on with our
customers with how many humans do they have and then how many agents are they deploying.
I think one example that I can personally tell you about in the quarter, we did a large transaction with a
large telecommunications company. It's incredible. And when I was talking to their CEO, she was asking
me, "How are we going to price the transaction," and so forth. And I can't remember the exact number
SALESFORCE, INC. FQ4 2025 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 26, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14
of the deal. I think it was, what, Brian? Maybe it was about $20 million in ACV, something like that, for
the year. Maybe it was $60 million TCV transaction. And then as part of that transaction, it's a mix of --
we're rebuilding this telecommunications company. So it's Sales Cloud, it's Service Cloud, it's Marketing
Cloud. It's all of our core clouds, but then also it's Agentforce. And the Agentforce component, I think, was
maybe $7 million in the transaction. So she was buying $7 million of Agentforce. She bought $13 million in
our products for humans, and I think that was about $20 million in total. These are approximate numbers.
I think that's kind of the idea that you're going to see us be able to deliver the right package for the right
customer.
Even if you look at Salesforce, as I mentioned, here we are working in this world, and kind of Brian has hit
on it, we did, what, 360,000 transactions in the quarter with Agentforce, on help.salesforce.com, trinity.
And then what do you have? About several thousand customer support reps and so we have our Service
Cloud running. We have Agentforce running. We have our different products running. Then, of course, our
Service Cloud is deeply integrated with our Sales Cloud and other products. So it's going to be a mix. And
I think that the mix is the most exciting thing.
I don't know any company that's 100% agents. I don't know of any company that doesn't need
automation for its humans. I don't know of any company that doesn't need a data cloud where it needs a
consistent common data repository for all of its agents to gain their intelligence. And I don't know of any
company that's not going to need an agentic layer. And that idea of having apps, data and agents, I think,
is going to be the winning combination.
Do you want to actually give the real details, Brian?
Brian Millham
President & COO
No, that's exactly right. This trinity, as you called it, Marc. CRM plus data plus agents is really what our
customers are coming to us for. Keith, our objective is how do we serve the customers and focus on
customer success, how do we give them what they need to go drive their business forward, both from
a productivity and from an efficiency perspective. The pricing models will change over time. There's no
doubt about it. The nice thing that we've seen with our customers is they really understand the ROI
associated with digital labor. What we're able to provide with agents is really driving the velocity of
transactions that we've seen. Marc mentioned the 3,000 transactions that we closed in the fourth quarter
really driven on our ROI model that people understand that they can get a tremendous amount of benefit
from agents.
We will probably move into the near future from conversations as we price most of our initial deals to
universal credit. It will allow our customers far more flexibility in the way they transact with us. But we
see this as a significant upside to our pricing structures going forward. And that's what we've seen in the
early days with our engagement with customers.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
To directly address, like here's a transaction that you're doing, let's say, a customer comes in, they're very
interested in building an agentic layer on their company, is that bringing other human-based clouds along
with it?
Brian Millham
President & COO
No doubt. And I think what we've seen is that we have incremental strength in our core technology, the
CRM core technology. You saw in the quarter, we had some good performance in both sales and Service
Cloud, both above 10% (sic) [ new bookings ] growth in the quarter. And so we are seeing people leverage
our core technology, the named pricing models with our core apps and agents together to go drive the
efficiencies that they're looking for.

Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
And I think they're going to really play it out. I mean if you do come to TrailheadDX and you do see that
new Tableau Next, I think what you're going to see is a Tableau that was only built for humans before, but
now is deeply integrated into the Data Cloud and has a deep agentic layer as well. So you're going to be
able to come to your own conclusions, get your hands on these products, talk to the customers. We're in
an exciting moment.
Operator
And our next question comes from Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Brian and Marc, I was wondering if you could just talk about -- you referred to it a little bit. But as
Agentforce builds, obviously, not every company is going to be ready to potentially go agentic today. But
is Agentforce having a bit of a halo effect around some of your other products, meaning, as we are on the
journey to get more monetization from Agentforce, are you seeing pickups or at least higher activity levels
in some of your other products that, to Brian, your point, sort of form this trinity?
Brian Millham
President & COO
That's exactly right. And we're seeing it in the way that our customers are using our technology, new
ideas, new workflows, new engagements. We talked about Lennar as an example, their ability to handle
leads after hours that they weren't able to get back to or respond to in a quick time frame are now able
to touch and engage with those leads. And that, of course, flows into their Salesforce automation system.
And so we are seeing this halo effect with our core technology. It is making every single one of our core
apps better as they deliver intelligence, underpinning these applications. And so it is the message that
we're delivering, this trinity of apps, data and agents, that is really compelling to our customers.
Operator
The next question is Raimo Lenschow, Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Perfect. Congrats from me as well. And Marc, like with Amy and Brian, you lose some very experienced
people on the team. What was the thinking in terms of combining those 2 roles? And how do you see that
playing out going forward?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, I'm so excited to have Robin come in as our new COFO. And I really think it's exciting because Robin
really has this kind of unique capability to deliver the Chief Operating Officer position and Chief Financial
Officer position. And I'll tell you, as we did the search, one of the really top candidates that we saw come
through held this position in another company. And I think as Robin and I were talking about that, the
leverage of having a COFO, this idea of the Financial Officer and the Chief Operating Officer really come
together as this incredible partnership to deliver this capability, just was a perfect match for us. I was
thinking about going with it with this outside candidate, and that's where I was fortunate to be able to
convince Robin to take the job.
And Robin, would you like to just say something and just kind of come in here and just tell us about how
excited you are to be part of the management team?
Robin L. Washington
Lead Independent Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
Sure, Marc. As you've heard Brian, Amy and Marc talk about it, it is an exciting opportunity for us
right now with Agentforce. So I am elated to be able to join forces with the operating team. It's an
exciting time in our industry as well. And as you've heard us talk about the trinity and our deeply unified
platform, I think we clearly are able to have something that's going to support our customers' growth and
productivity in this new area -- in this new era, I should say, with the result of sustainable and profitable
revenue growth for Salesforce long term.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. And I just want to also -- I should also really thank -- Miguel Milano, as you probably know, came
back as our Chief Revenue Officer about a year ago, and he decided to rejoin us after some cajoling. And
I've asked him to work directly for me, running our worldwide sales organization. And so I've been so
thrilled about that. And I also have to thank Srini, who's our Chief Engineering Officer, who's now our
Chief Engineering and Services Officer, who's taken on customer service and support. And it's been a
rebalancing of our management team. So we have this amazing new executive with Robin. I couldn't be
more excited to have her by my side. And just as a little side note, Robin will tell you, I've been trying to
convince her to join the company for over a decade. And so I finally got her after a lot of selling. So we're
thrilled to have Robin with us and joining us as director and operating executive from the Board.
And then having Miguel is so exciting. Of course, having Parker with me as well is so critical. And also,
as I mentioned, Srini is running services and engineering. And Steve Fisher, being promoted recently to
our Chief Product Officer or actually our Chief Technology Officer, running products; and our Chief Product
Officer, David Schmaier, also with expanded responsibilities working directly for me. David is now our Chief
Product and Impact Officer. And I couldn't be more thrilled. I also have a great Chief of Staff, Kendall, and
a whole team around me with so many incredible functions and capabilities. And of course, smiling and
waving at me across the table is Sabastian Niles, my Chief Legal Officer, who has done an unbelievable job
since joining the company.
So I don't think I've ever had a better management team. I mean it's hard to beat Amy and Brian, but I
think maybe we did it. We're really thrilled. So sorry, Amy and Brian, to see you go. [Foreign Language]
But welcome to the new management team, and we're so thrilled to have them with us, and we're so
excited to start fiscal year '26 with an absolute bang.
And Robin, did you want to end with any parting comments?
Robin L. Washington
Lead Independent Director
No.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Up next is Brent Thill, Jefferies.
Brent John Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Marc, just on DOGE and the impact of what the federal and state -- I'm curious if you can discuss your
role and what you think this means for Salesforce.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, I don't have any role. I think I'm -- of course, I'm coming at this with a beginner's mind, like I'm
sure all of us are, that we want to see what they are able to deliver with the new administration. We're

huge fans of the United States of America. We want us to be a successful country as we possibly can be.
And that also includes having something that I think is critical and important for us, which is a balanced
budget, something I've encouraged every President that I've worked with for quite a few administrations
to achieve.
We're thrilled with our relationship with the government. You know that we have so many agencies that
depend on us from providing support for veterans through our Veterans Administration and so many other
groups. And I think even DOGE is using Slack to manage their communication and coordination. So we'll
work closely with the government. We'll do anything we can to help them succeed, and we wish them only
the best. And we're here to help at every step of the way, and we want the U.S. to be as successful as it
possibly can.
Operator
Next up from JPMorgan, it's Mark Murphy.
Mark Ronald Murphy
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Marc, you had mentioned this labor arbitrage and that jobs are going to evolve. When you think through
the scale of that kind of an opportunity, how much labor do you think you can augment or replace? For
instance, could a company with 1,000 employees slow its hiring or stop hiring and just layer in a couple of
hundred Agentforce bots and maybe accelerate its growth? And then further to Brent's point, can we apply
that concept to federal government agencies? If they have 3 million workers and some of them are going
to leave voluntarily, could they layer in hundreds of thousands of these Agentforce bots and see some
greater efficiency?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, I think that I could wave you away and say I don't really know yet, but I will tell you that since I'm
the CEO of a 75,000-person company -- or how many employees do we have now, 75,000, 76,000 -- so
let's just look at us. So we have, what, 9,000 support agents. We really are seeing tremendous efficiency
with help.salesforce.com. So we may see the opportunity to rebalance some of those folks in the sales
and marketing and other functions. We're really excited about that. I would say that we definitely have
seen a lot of efficiency with engineering and with some of the new tools that I've seen, especially some
of these high-performance coding tools. One of the key members of my staff who's here in the room
with us has just showed me one of his new examples of what we're able to do with these coding tools,
pretty awesome. And we're not going to hire any new engineers this year. We're seeing 30% productivity
increase on engineering.
And we're going to really continue to ride that up. And we're going to grow sales pretty dramatically this
year. Brian has got a big vision for how to grow the sales organization probably another 10% to 20%,
I hope, this year because we're seeing incredible levels of demand. I think every company who is our
customer or prospect wants us to come in and start talking about what we're going to do with them and
how we're going to transform them.
Everybody sees the opportunity. I think that the big message I have for a lot of CEOs that I meet with is,
"Hey, we're the last generation of CEOs to only manage humans." I think every CEO going forward is going
to manage humans and agents together. I know that's what I'm doing. So this is what I have to think
about every single day as a CEO. And I think everyone is going to have to start to think about that.
It's definitely starting because, as I mentioned, I was with a large CEO group last week, and it was a
topic of conversation in every single person that I met with. And whether it's those life sciences CEOs
that we mentioned or financial services CEOs or manufacturing CEOs, in every example, they can see
how agents are going to be able to augment their workforce. And I think you can see it also in the global
economy that I think productivity is going to rise without additions to more human labor, which is good
because human labor is not increasing in the global workforce. So you have a stagnant human workforce
worldwide.

So if you want productivity to go up and you want GDP to grow up and you want growth, I think that
digital labor is going to be one of the catalysts to make that happen. And I was talking with a significant
economist and an economic leader last week, and I think that they -- I think everyone is on the same
page that we could see something really dramatic.
And this is our main focus as a company. We aren't building huge $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion, $100
billion data centers. We're not doing some of these kind of engineering efforts that may or may not have
some kind of huge payoff, but is going to take down all of our cash and all of our margin for the next
several years. We're like augmenting our existing product line with artificial intelligence, taking advantage
of these incredible investments that are being made in infrastructure by others, and we're going to deliver
the digital labor revolution. This is our goal. Our goal is to be the #1 provider of digital labor in the world.
That's it. I don't think there really is another goal. You can say we're the #1 AI CRM, which we already
are, but when you're the #1 AI CRM, you're also going to lead the digital labor revolution. And that is
going to be the focus of fiscal year '26. As I said, this is the year of digital labor, and it is going to be the
year where every Trailblazer is going to become an Agentblazer.
Operator
The last question comes from Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.
Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
We'll miss you, Brian and Amy. Congratulations, Robin. And one for you, Marc. There's a lot of talk about
how we're moving from model building and training to the inference layer. And also as part of that shift to
agentic technology, there's been a lot of debate about the SaaS technology and the business model. The
SaaS tech stack that you built and pioneered, how does that fit into the agentic world? Is there a risk that
SaaS just becomes a crowded database? It sounds really terrible, but I'm sure you have an opinion. I'd
love to hear it.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Okay. Well, Kash, I really appreciate that. And look, I've heard that Microsoft narrative, too. So I watched
the podcast you watched, and that's a very interesting idea. Here's how I look at it, which is, I believe
there is kind of a holy trinity here of AI CRM, which is the apps, the data and the agents. And these
three things have to kind of work together. And I kind of put my money where our mouth is where we
kind of built it and we delivered it. And you can see the 380,000 conversations that we had as point of
evidence here in the last 90 days on our service and with a very high resolution rate of 84%. You can go
to help.salesforce.com, and you can see that today.
Now Microsoft has had Copilot available for, I think, about 2 years or more than 2 years. And I know that
they're the reseller of OpenAI and they've invested, they kind of repackaged this ChatGPT, whatever.
But where on their side are they delivering agents? Where in their company have they done this? Are
they a best practice? Because I think that while they can say such a thing, do they have humans and
agents working together to create customer success? Are they rebalancing their workforce with humans
and agents? I think that it's a very interesting point that, yes, the agentic layer is very important, but it
doesn't operate by itself. It operates with data, with a Data Cloud that has to be federated through your
company, to all your data sources.
And humans, we're still here. I'm here. I just knocked on the table in case anybody wants to know, this is
not an agent. I mean, I guess for not very long that this actually is not going to be a good test. But just
know that I am here and you could call me or text me, Kash. And I am using those apps, too. Like I said,
I've got the new Tableau. It's amazing. The Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, I use. I use all of our products.
Slack, I was just on. And that idea that our apps and our Data Cloud and our agentic layer, all integrated
