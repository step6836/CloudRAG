Presentation
Operator
Welcome to Salesforce First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this
call is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mike Spencer,
Executive Vice President of Finance and Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Michael Spencer
Executive Vice President of Investor Relations

And with that, let me hand the call to Marc.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
All right. Hey, thanks so much, Mike. Really appreciate everything you're doing. And before I get into all
of these exciting highlights from the quarter, there's so much to talk about. I just want to say a few words
about Informatica. And I'm sure everybody knows I love Informatica. I've been working with this company
since probably 2006. Sohaib Abbasi, former CEO last night, sent me a photo of me and him together at
their user conference, and I'm so excited that we have signed this definitive agreement to acquire them
for $8 billion, which upon close is going to unite our #1 AI CRM and of course, their #1 AI MDM and ETL
and bringing these things together, well, I couldn't be more excited about this acquisition.
I know that many people on the call know Informatica so well just like I do. You may not know everything
that's happened with Informatica. I've followed it very closely. The way they've rewritten their product
into the cloud, their incredible engineering leadership, especially some of their incredible new engineering
centers and what they've built is just awesome. And I'll tell you that there's just a few technology
companies I've just been more impressed with. In fact, we're a customer. We're a partner. We're an
investor in Informatica. We really love the company. We love the people. We've loved the leadership.
And I have to say, we probably spent the last 20 years discussing how to bring the companies together.
We spent a lot of time not only with their new CEO, but -- Amit, who's fantastic but with their engineering
teams. And I even sent our group over to India to see what they were doing there, and it all led really to
this incredible moment.
So it's an awesome acquisition for us. It's a transformational step. It's a great price for the company.
This transaction -- and I think that Robin will get into this because we've been very focused on staying --
really in our acquisition framework, we spent a lot of time thinking about what is it going to take to buy a

company of scale, how much are we really willing to spend, are we willing to walk away like we did a year
ago when numbers are not right. We just want to be as disciplined as possible.
And look, at the end of the day, I know all of you already know this, but this is a great price for a great
company. It's got great multiples. It's accretive. It's nondilutive. It's coming together in an incredible
way. And this is a moment where Informatica is more important to our customers than ever before
because of what's happening with AI. And I think everyone who is going through an AI transformation,
every business, including mine, we're going to talk about some great businesses that are going through
transformations whether it's Pepsi or Falabella or OpenTable, et cetera, but every AI transformation is a
data transformation. And you don't see it on the consumer side because when you're using a consumer AI,
you have to remember that the data set has kind of been prefabricated for you. That is the training data
and everything is put together. It's an amalgamated data set applied to this consumer AI model. That's
not how an enterprise AI really works. You have to have your enterprise data together to get the result
that you want.
And when you look at these very high functioning agents, and we'll talk about 1 that we have -- we have
so -- I mean we've done now 7,000 or 8,000 Agentforce deals. I think we've got 4,000 paid Agentforce
customers, is $100 million in Agentforce ARR, $1 billion and more than Data Cloud and Agentforce ARR.
But when you look at these companies that are doing it right, they have got their data together. And
that is what is really the key. This ability to unify or harmonize or activate all the data across the entire
enterprise.
And if you can imagine this idea that you want to deploy all of this incredible agentic data, well, you've got
to get your data right. And Informatica combined with Salesforce's Data Cloud, combined with Tableau,
combined with other key assets that we're going to bring to bear, this is what is creating this incredible
data business. And I mean, we have big goals for what -- how the size and scale that, that data business
can get to. Robin will go through that in detail. And we will really work hard to advance this mission of
Informatica to make sure that our customers' data is incredible.
So anyway, let me turn it over to Robin to give her perspective on Informatica, and then we'll get into the
quarter.
Robin L. Washington
President, Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Director
Thanks, Marc. We're incredibly excited to welcome Informatica to Salesforce upon closing. Our responsible
M&A framework that Marc just spoke to is a key pillar of our capital allocation strategy, and it's focused
on 3 areas: customer success and strategic fit, acceleration, and value. Our acquisition strategy is
methodical. It's patient and it's decisive, targeting transformative assets like Informatica when the
calculus aligns to maximize customer success.
You already heard from Marc on why this will be a critical complementary asset for accelerating our growth
strategy in data and AI and apps. I'm going to focus on value, our third pillar. We expect to achieve
accretion on non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow by year 2 post close. We are
laser focused on speed of integration. By leveraging our focus on operational excellence and our M&A
integration playbook, our goal is to achieve accretion as quickly as possible, which is a significant evolution
in our M&A strategy and in line with recent acquisitions.
And in line with our M&A framework, we prioritize non-dilutive forms of consideration. As a result of
our durable free cash flow generation and strong balance sheet, this deal will be financed through a
combination of cash and new debt, resulting in no share dilution. This transaction is not expected to
disrupt our capital return strategy, inclusive of our share repurchase program and our dividend.
Finally, we expect to close by early fiscal year '27. We view this acquisition as a key enabler for
Salesforce's next phase of AI-driven growth and believe it will amplify our market differentiation and
deliver sustained benefits for all Salesforce stakeholders.
Now back to you, Marc.

Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
All right. Right on. Well, Robin, thank you so much, and you are doing a fantastic job as our new COFO.
So, so great that you're here. And I'm looking forward to you all having the chance to interact with
Robin on the call. And look it, overall, let's just talk about this. We are just extremely excited to welcome
Informatica, and I can't wait to close the deal. And I think that this is going to be an absolutely incredible
opportunity.
So look, let's move on to the quarter. We delivered $9.83 billion in Q1 revenue. That was up 8% yearover-year. Subscription and support, 9% in constant currency. We saw very strong growth in our small
and medium market business. It really surprised us. Both of them achieved really strong double-digit new
bookings growth. We continue to deliver on these margin goals that we have. We delivered 32.3% nonGAAP margin in the quarter. And we delivered $6.5 billion in operating cash flow. We have $60.9 billion
in RPO, up 13% year-over-year, and we had exceptional performance with cRPO growing 11% year-overyear in constant currency.
And we're raising our fiscal year '26 guidance by $400 million to $41.3 billion at the high end of the range.
I mean sometimes you have a quarter when everything is going right for you. That means revenue is
going right. Bookings is going right. You're kicking off the quarter. Q1 is always a high risk quarter, but
even currency is moving in the right direction. This was just a great quarter, and that is why we're able to
deliver this incredible raise.
So a few enterprise software companies probably have ever delivered these kinds of numbers. It's kind
of even a shock to me that we're delivering this $41.3 billion in guidance, and we are now just very well
positioned to take advantage of this multitrillion-dollar opportunity in AI and enterprise software and
digital labor. And now in just 2 quarters, we are also -- just since we launched Agentforce, you think about
that, we now have more than 4,000 paid deals as I mentioned, more than 8,000 in total across every
industry.
We've got 800 customers already in production with Agentforce, including amazing companies like ENGIE,
and that has been a success -- incredible success story and with incredible velocity and conversations
in OpenTable, Finnair, Grupo Globo, Falabella. We've talked about so many of these. We're going to talk
about so many more. And we have launched hundreds of prebuilt Agentforce templates for different
industries, roles, tasks, making it faster and easier for customers to deploy Agentforce. We're learning a
lot about how to make agents successful, productive, how to scale, how to tune our own organization, and
really get our customers all ready for this AI transformation in the enterprise led by agents.
Now earlier this month, we introduced our Flex Credits. It's a new consumption-based pricing model.
That's how we've tuned our pricing after a huge amount of customer feedback. And next month, we're
going to add FedRAMP High authorization for Agentforce, so the U.S. public sector can also experience this
incredible success. So no one else is delivering what we think digital labor is at this scale.
Now of course, Agentforce does agentic augmentation for employees. Agentforce is also doing it
directly to consumers. I think that we are really delivering at this point probably more agents and more
conversations and more capability to more enterprises than any other vendor in the world. I really see us
as the #1 agent platform already. And it's only been a few months. In fact, Agentforce reached more than
$100 million in AOV. It's much faster than any product in our history, and we're not even fully deployed on
all geographies, currencies or languages. And to that point, I was in Japan last week and they are -- they
can't wait to get Agentforce running in Japanese, which we're about to deliver for them.
So the success of Agentforce is building on the strong growth we've seen in our Data Cloud. Data
readiness, as I mentioned, with Informatica is critical for every company. And in this quarter, our Data
Cloud, just our Data Cloud surpassed 22 trillion records, up 175% year-over-year. Nearly 60% of our top
100 deals included investments in both Data Cloud and AI. And we are still working really to be able to
kind of communicate with every single one of our customers on the importance of Data Cloud, and yet
Data Cloud just remains this incredibly fast moving product.

50% of Data Cloud's Q1 new bookings came from existing customers. I think that's really important
because it really speaks to the adoption of the product and the incredible usage by the customers who
have it. And even though Agentforce is only in its second quarter, 30% of its bookings also came from
customers increasing their consumption, another key point of these 2 products.
Now these are early days, but this flywheel, AI agent flywheel, it's working. Data Cloud and ARR grew
more than 120% year-over-year, and it's more than $1 billion part of our business. That is amazing. The
pace of innovation has been incredible. I've just never seen our company, really any company move this
fast with a new technology.
We've also witnessed how we've pivoted the entire company around our vision for AI. That is the idea
that we have. These incredible apps, every single one of these apps being rebuilt for this incredible AI
revolution, the Data Cloud itself -- and not to mention, of course, when you start to look at it, you've got
the agentic layer and don't forget about our metadata platform. I'm going to get into that in a second, but
I just think it all played out just last week when we went -- looked at the New York World Tour.
I know many of you were there, and you could really feel the energy, 10,000 customers, everyone
looking at technology that just a year ago did not exist. And now they are on the very cusp of a huge
transformation for their enterprises.
Now when I talk about agents and data and apps and metadata, that's what we really call our ADAM
framework. It's in our experience to see now these 4 elements, the app, the data, the agents and the
metadata, that make Salesforce unique, that companies need to achieve the real promise of agentic
AI. And you could really see that also play out when we got to our Tableau conference this quarter. If
you were in San Diego, you saw Tableau Next. And what you saw was the DataFam. That's the Tableau
community kind of fully inspired because not only were they looking at Tableau Next, this incredible new
product, but what they saw was Tableau, the Tableaus they love. And they also saw an agentic layer,
and they saw it deeply integrated into our data cloud and all running on our metadata platform. That's
our ADAM framework, the agents, the data, the apps, the metadata all together. Tableau Next is a great
example of where we're going with all of our technology in our company, and customers are so excited.
Slack is really another example. Slack is, of course, where I believe you're going to really begin and end
every Agentforce conversation. It's the conversational interface for managing all of your work across apps,
systems, teams. And Service Cloud, Sales Cloud, Tableau Next, any Salesforce app can live inside Slack.
It's a very fluid and natural user experience. I know a lot of you are on Slack. And with Agentforce in
Slack, every employee has a digital teammate that can make notes for your meeting, summarize your
Slack channels. And you really see like AI taking place on Slack when you look at Slack recap or you look
at agents just coming right into your channels to talk to you in real time. And you can imagine how all of
these new kinds of apps that are appearing in the marketplace where AI and agents are all happening, this
is this incredible agent user interface with Slack.
So in this new agentic AI era, every company is going to say that they have agents. Well, I think every
company does say that they have agents. But without these 4 parts of what we call ADAM, the -- really
the agents, the data, the apps, the metadata framework, you're just not really able to deliver this
complete experience for the enterprise, including delivering digital labor. That's why so many customers
are achieving success now with Agentforce and so many of our new offerings that are using this incredible
combination.
Let's talk about some customers. Finnair is using Agentforce to help manage customer service for
12 million passengers. Agentforce is already having thousands of conversations a week with Finnair
customers, and the airline is aiming to automate 80% of customer service queries and reduce new rep
onboarding time by 25% with Agentforce. It's been an incredible success story, and that's not the only
airline. I think you remember, we've talked about Singapore Air. We're talking to so many airlines about
how they not only can use all our Customer 360 apps, not just the Data Cloud, not just our meta platform
but build this agentic capability around the airline. This is going to be a huge opportunity for that entire
industry, which is so customer service obsessed.

Now I have to tell you about this great company, Falabella, and for those of you who have ever been
to Falabella, you already know, I guess, the analog (sic) [ analogy ] would be -- I'm speaking from San
Francisco, so I'll just say it's kind of the Nordstroms of Latin America in some way. And this is a Latin
American retail conglomerate. It's a great example of why Agentforce is winning.
Here's this company that's pioneering Agentforce just a couple of months ago in their Colombia business.
And then it's so successful, they're actually deploying it on WhatsApp, which we hadn't really seen before.
And they're using WhatsApp. The customers are coming in. They're coming in and, "Hey, what's my order?
What's going on?" And this what's my order use case is the main thing that's driving Falabella, and boom,
all of a sudden, they go, "You know what, this is working so well. We're going all over Latin America," and
what was kind of, I think, a low 6-figure deal. I mean, Miguel is going to have to come in here and tell me,
turned into like a $1 million deal overnight. What?
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
$300,000 number.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes, it was $300,000, right, from just Colombia.
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
It's become $1 million now.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Now it's $1 million. So that's a great example. And when we look at another one, OpenTable, we've been
talking about this story for a while, which is [ Glenn ] is doing a great job deploying Agentforce. And he
started with the restaurants. Then, he did employees. And now he's like doing the consumers, and this is
an incredible thing that OpenTable has been so successful, and I'm so proud of [ Glenn ].
And now we see [ Ramon ] doing the same thing at PepsiCo, where he's trying to bring together the
beverage business and the snack business. He's kind of building a one PepsiCo vision with the Data Cloud.
I think he uses 11 clouds, right? Miguel is that right?
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
All of them [indiscernible].
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Every single one, and then delivering a whole agentic layer around PepsiCo is so incredible. And another
Latin American success is Grupo Globo. The Brazilian media conglomerate purchased Agentforce in Q4.
In less than 3 months, Agentforce basically boosted Globo's retention rate by 22%, driving revenue
upgrades, cross selling, converting nonsubscribers. It's very cool.
And I guess one of the surprise stories is ENGIE who's a long-time Salesforce customer, known so many
of the CEOs, amazing company doing all kinds of great things in the energy marketplace, driven out
of Europe. And now they're assisting 83% of their users with Agentforce. I think it's -- the number of
conversations that are happening are some of the highest that we've seen. It's really cool. So -- and I've
got other stories. We -- you've heard me talk already about 1-800Accountant and Smartsheet and so
many other customers. This is just the beginning of what's going on with AI, Agentforce, Data Cloud or
metadata framework. We can go into it in Q&A if you want.

And now I'll turn it over to Robin.
Robin L. Washington
President, Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Director
Thank you, Marc. I've been in the COFO role for a little over 50 days now, and I've spent that time deeply
listening to our shareholders, employees and customers. And what I've heard has been instrumental in
shaping my top priorities for the year ahead, which are delivering customer success and accelerating AI
adoption to drive growth, driving operational excellence to maximize shareholder value and responsible
capital allocation. We're already making progress against these priorities.
First, let me share a few details on how we're delivering customer success and accelerating AI adoption
to drive growth. Our core clouds continue to be a cornerstone of our product portfolio with Sales Cloud,
Service Cloud and Platform in 9 of our top 10 wins. More than half of our top 10 (sic) [ top 100 ] deals
included 6 or more clouds with Sales and Service Cloud in nearly 80% of those deals. As customers adopt
more clouds, they unlock the full power of our deeply unified platform with Data Cloud and Agentforce
built into every one of our applications.
This drives the flywheel of success as well as lower attrition as customers realize the benefits of our
platform. It's early days, but the flywheel is already turning. 30% of Q1 Agentforce new bookings came
through expansion deals from existing Agentforce customers. And as Marc just shared, our customers
continue to invest heavily in data cloud to prepare for their agentic future.
In Q1, we closed more than 30 net new annual bookings over $1 million that include both data and
AI. Tableau was included in more than 70% of our deals over $1 million and MuleSoft in nearly half of
those deals. This underscores how important data is to our customers like Box, Deloitte and Boeing. Our
ecosystem plays a critical role in driving customer success and growth. Our partners were included in 7 of
our top 10 deals of the quarter.
Today, Salesforce is the fastest growing ISV on AWS Marketplace, which has driven hundreds of
transactions for us since launch, including 2 of our top 5 deals this quarter. Finally, our industry-specific
solutions continue to deliver significant value to customers like the U.S. Air Force and University of
Chicago Medicine. Nearly half of our top 100 deals included an industry cloud.
Our Life Sciences Cloud had a strong quarter. We've seen incredible momentum with more than 40 global
customers including Pfizer and Takeda, which was a Q1 win for us. Takeda will use the Life Sciences cloud
with Agentforce and Data Cloud to unify its data and deploy agents across medical, commercial and
patient care operations. And we are continuing the momentum. We unveiled a brand-new next-gen mobile
application for Life Sciences Cloud for field reps just last week.
As customers adopt more agents, upgrade to premium editions and leverage our industry solutions, we
see greater expansion and stronger customer retention. With data and AI, that value is accelerating,
driving even more impactful customer outcomes.
As you all just heard, we are innovating faster than ever. And this is a core part of how we will drive
operational excellence to maximize shareholder value. And we're positioned better to leverage our own
innovation to drive efficiency and profitability, similar to what our products bring to our customers.
Let me give you 2 great examples. Our sales agent in Slack is transforming how our teams sell. Our AEs
have already logged over 21,000 interactions, simplifying everyday sales activity, saving our teams over
44,000 hours annually. Further, Data Cloud is amplifying that impact, cutting lead routing from 20 minutes
to 19 seconds in Slack.
In customer support, Agentforce has handled 750,000 cases and is on track to surpass 1 million help
portal requests this quarter, cutting case volume by 7% year-over-year. As a result, we have reduced
some of our hiring needs, enabling us to rebalance and redeploy 500 customer support employees to
higher impact data plus AI roles by year-end, driving $50 million in savings. Showing what's working
for us helps our customers envision their future, and I'm excited to keep scaling these efforts internally.
That is the power of Salesforce on Salesforce. Utilizing our own unified platform infused with data plus AI

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
across our enterprise will drive sustained efficiencies and leverage across our P&L, and we are just getting
started.
Now you've all seen the numbers, but let me provide a little more context on the quarter. For the first
quarter, revenue was $9.83 billion, up 8% year-over-year in nominal and constant currency. Subscription
and support revenues grew 9% in constant currency. As a reminder, this incorporates a 1 point headwind
from the leap year last February. Again, this quarter, pricing and packaging continue to be a key lever for
us, most notably in sales and service.
Q1 revenue attrition ended the quarter at slightly above 8%, in line with recent trends. As we continue to
focus on customer success, we are incentivizing on a new metric with our field reps, net new AOV, which
measures new and renewal performance together. This provides a clear view on overall business expansion
and enables our teams to focus on overall health of the customer.
Our business benefits from a balanced portfolio of products and customers across geographies, segments
and industries. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong new business growth in the U.K., France,
Canada and Asia Pacific, particularly South Asia, while some pockets in EMEA remain constrained. From a
segment perspective, as you heard from Marc, we saw strong performance in our small and mid-market
business this quarter. And from an industry perspective, in Q1, comms and media and health and life
sciences performed well, while retail and consumer goods and public sector were more measured.
On operating expenses, we continue to focus our investments in sales and marketing and R&D to drive
data and AI innovation, helping fuel Customer 360 and future top line leverage.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. Remaining performance obligation ended Q1 at $60.9 billion,
up 13% year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation, or cRPO, ended Q1 at $29.6 billion,
up 12% year-on-year in nominal and 11% in constant currency, which is better than expected, driven by
strong renewal performance. Q1 operating cash flow was a healthy $6.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year.
And as we focus on responsible capital allocation, we are continuing to invest where it matters most to our
business and customers while maintaining a clear focus on efficiency and profitable growth to maximize
shareholder value. On capital return, in Q1, we increased our dividend payout by 4% and returned more
than $3 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This brings our total cash return since the
inception of our capital return program to more than $24 billion.
Finally, let's cover guidance. We are pleased to raise fiscal year '26 revenue guidance to $41 billion to
$41.3 billion, an increase of $400 million on the high end, driven by foreign exchange tailwinds. This
results in growth of approximately 8% to 9% year-over-year in nominal and 8% in constant currency.
On foreign exchange, we now expect a $250 million tailwind, up $400 million since our last print. We are
reiterating our subscription and support revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year in constant
currency, driven by the momentum in Data Cloud and some contribution from Agentforce this year. This is
partially offset by weakness in marketing and commerce and slower growth in our exploration base.
Our guidance reflects a consistent demand environment and assumes those trends continue. Of course, if
the environment changes, our results may be impacted. As we continue to drive operational excellence,
we are pleased to reiterate our non-GAAP operating margins of 34% and gap of 21.6% for the year,
building on the continuous improvement from the last few years. Our annual guidance on operating cash
flow growth of 10% to 11% and free cash flow growth of 9% to 10% remains unchanged.
Now turning to Q2 guidance. Revenue is expected to be $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion, up 8% to 9% yearover-year in nominal and 7% to 8% in constant currency. cRPR (sic) [ cRPO ] growth for Q2 is expected to
be 10% year-over-year in nominal, including a $300 million FX tailwind, resulting in 9% constant currency
growth. As a reminder, while we have seen more normalized bookings growth recently, cRPO will continue
to be materially impacted by the cumulative effect of the measured sales performance that started in Q2
fiscal year '23 and our slower exploration base.
In closing, we're starting FY '26 strong with a trusted, deeply unified platform, the most technical
leadership team in our history, and a solid foundation to accelerate efficiency and growth. We truly have

a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lead our customers in this digital labor revolution with Data Cloud,
Agentforce, our Customer 360 apps, all deeply unified within our metadata platform.
And lastly, a huge thank you to our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders for the
warm welcome. It's an exciting time to be in this new role at Salesforce.
With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.

Question and Answer
Operator
Your first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Congratulations on a great start to the fiscal year. I guess this is a question for all of you guys. The
excitement around Agentforce in the Data Cloud is palpable and how you guys speak about it. And we
hear a lot about it when we talk to customers and when we talk to channel partners as well. I think what a
lot of investors are wondering is the transmission mechanism of when does this become a bigger driver for
the overall growth rate at Salesforce. 10% is good, but we'd like to see acceleration against that. We'd like
to see you guys getting back to more of like a growth footing.
Can you talk to us about some of the puts and takes of that? I'm sure there's some timing issues involved.
Robin, you talked about a weak expiry base. But when can we really see the trajectory of Salesforce start
to tick up from here?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, I'm really excited about that question because, obviously, we want to have growth. We also want
to have good, solid balanced execution as well. And this is, I think, a big commitment of the company
that we are going to -- first and foremost, we're going to maintain our margin framework. We're going to
maintain our cash flow framework. You heard about the very disciplined approach to M&A.
And so before I go into my pitch on growth, I would really want to make sure that everybody heard what
I just said that I'm committed to all of those things, but I'm also deeply committed to growth. And growth
is really where we're at right now. And you can see why growth is so important because we are in a
moment in time where every company is coming to us saying how do I go forward and how do I deliver
this incredible agentic revolution.
Now what that means for us is a number of things that we all have to put into place. One thing is we need
to -- now that we kind of have our, I would say, kind of the margin transformation behind us, the cash flow
transformation behind us, the buyback transformation behind us, the dividend transformation behind us
and also, I would say, we have the acquisition transformation behind us because we saw the acquisition
yesterday and also the acquisition last year of Own. But now there's one more huge transformation that is
really underway, and it's really driven by this agentic AI moment. And that is the growth transformation.
And our approach to that is going to be really focused, first and foremost, is on distribution. And Miguel
Milano is here. He's the Chief Revenue Officer, works directly for me. We also have at the table Srini,
our Chief Engineering Officer; and Sabastian, our Chief Legal Officer; and of course, Robin. And all of us
together are deeply committed to continuing the incredible success of the company.
Now how would we even accelerate growth at this level? Well, the way we would do it is we've really
identified that there's a lot of growth happening already in the company. One of the big areas of growth
that's already happening is in small and medium business. Another area that happened in the first quarter
is in the mid-market. And we even saw a lot of signs for incredible growth in a lot of our geographic
regions like Japan and others and in our core technologies, like we mentioned, with Data Cloud and AI.
When we start to put all of these pieces together, that's where we also decided to now hire another 1,000
to 2,000 more salespeople because there are a lot of parts of our business that need investment to grow,
and we are doing that as well. But I want to get back. We're still going to maintain that margin framework.
So while we're making these huge investments, while we are scaling distribution again, while we're doing
all these things that have been kind of on pause, I would say, for the last 3 years for a lot of good reasons,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13
now we're really saying, okay, we can actually do some things. In these key areas that are growing, we
can supercharge them.
And Miguel, do you want to just speak to some of the growth initiatives that you have underway and some
of the things that you're especially excited about, not only performance in the quarter but how you see
over the next 1 to 2 years from a growth opportunity for the company and how we're going to rapidly
move from where we are this year at $41 billion and into these higher revenue levels, hopefully, in the 50s
and 60s but while maintaining the margin and cash flow disciplines that we have now picked up as a core
competency?
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
Absolutely, Marc. Keith, thank you for the question. Good question. Obviously, growth is our obsession.
I shared the very positive sentiment that both Marc and Robin already shared in this call. I don't think
we've been -- we've ever been in a better position in this business. I can tell you, there is some qualitative
comments that we made about ADAM, our framework, our deeply unified platform. That flywheel, it's
incredible, is starting to happen. It's great to be in 2 markets that are seminal, the data activation
market and also the agentic market. Everything is coming together, and it's reinforcing the power of our
applications.
By the way, we're bringing this to public sector very soon. But I think I'm also excited about some hard
facts in go to market that are nondisputable. The expanded capacity that Marc referred to. Today, we have
13,000 AEs. By the way, we not only have the record number of AEs in the history of the company. This
is 14% growth year-on-year today. At the end of the quarter, it will be 19% growth. At the end of the
year, it's going to be 22% growth. But also, we've been extremely diligent over the last 2 years to put this
capacity in the areas of higher productivity and higher growth.
We also have very strong pipeline, open pipeline and also great pipe gain momentum and velocity, all in
the double-digit growth. Also, as Marc referred earlier in his comments, we have an incredibly well-oiled
run rate machine. I mean run rate is nearly 60% of our business and the small and medium businesses
approaching 50%, and that is humming. It's growing in the mid, high teens. Of course, we are well known
for how we are able to structure and create big deals, and that motion is strengthening. Pricing and
packaging is also helping Marc a lot. It's making our customers -- we're making it much easier for our
customers to simplify the relationship with us and to own our fully unified platform, also increasing ASP
per seat.
Overall, I couldn't be more excited. I joined the company, as you know, in 2011, and the momentum
is incredible. AWS Marketplace, just to mention, I think is incredible. The partnership with AWS, we
transacted $2 billion of business through them, hundreds of transactions, and it's tripling year-on-year
right now. I've never felt as strong as I feel now in the future of the company.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Because I really want to get into this to one more level because, obviously, I'm completely in sympathy
with this. But number one is, obviously, you came in the company in 2011. We had asked -- we've been
recruiting you for many years. You were at Oracle, running a huge part of their business. And then before
that, you were at McKinsey as well. Then, you unfortunately left Salesforce, I think, 4 years ago or 5 years
ago to become the Chief Revenue Officer of another company. We won't go into that, but then we patiently
recruited you back, and we got you back, what is it, 2 years ago now.
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
Two years ago.

And now you've been here for 2 years. You're now working directly for me as the CRO. Our 15 core
distribution unit leaders all are reporting directly to you. What was your biggest surprise in Q1? What was
it, when you look back -- you obviously had a great quarter. What was it at Q1 where we went, "Wow,
that was a huge surprise. I should be investing more here, here and here because these are -- these are
growth levers I really didn't realize we even had."?
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
I mean, obviously, it's a leading question. You know the answer, Marc. I have to say I was shocked to
see the momentum that we were enjoying in the low end of the market, small, medium and mid-market.
In fact, we -- that made us really rethink the exercise of capacity allocation. And we realized that we
had allocated enough growth in some of the areas but not across the 15 OUs. So even within Q2, we are
reallocating capacity to the low end of the market.
And the other thing that became very important, and this goes back to Keith's question is, I mean, it's
great to be owning 2 segments, the Data Cloud side, the data activation business and the agentic business
that is growing triple digit. But what if we could grow even faster? I think the participation across my
organization needs to be improved. I mean we want -- I told my whole organization, 13,000 AEs, you
need to sell a Data Cloud deal in Q2. You need to sell an Agentforce deal in Q2. I think if we can grow that
instead of triple digit, high triple digit, that would accelerate the growth of the company.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
When you really look at kind of distribution capacity expansion year-over-year, by the time we get to this
end of this fiscal year, what's your dream in terms of what our total distribution capability? What is the
percentage growth that you all have seen?
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
So we are aiming at 22% overall capacity growth. We're going to be growing more on the low end of the
market, the small, medium business and the mid-market. But that's an incredibly healthy growth. We've
never -- I mean, in the last 2 years, we've been flat most of the time and now to be able to come into H2
with a 14% growth.
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
These market segments, it's also distribution capacity expansion. And one more question I have for you,
what are some of these geographic regions that are just blowing your mind in terms of their insatiability
for our products and capabilities?
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
I mean, as Robin referred to, we can -- we are lucky because we run a highly diversified portfolio of
businesses across industries but also across geographies. We saw some momentum in Canada. The whole
South Asia is on fire. The whole APAC is on fire. And even in Europe, there are great pockets of growth.
France and U.K. outdelivered in the quarter. And of course, there are other places where we see a more
measured performance.
But overall, we see demand across every view. I get asked many times, okay, do you see a different
behavior and the truth is every geography, every account, every segment, every industry, they need 2
things. They need to activate their data, and they need an agentic ledger on top of their application. I
think Data Cloud and Agentforce are so powerful that now many companies are wondering why would I
deploy any touch point, any customer's touch point on an app that is not a Salesforce app. It doesn't make
sense.

Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.
Brent John Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Robin, just on the growth rate. I'm just curious given some of the macro and tariffs on uncertainties. Have
you seen any uncertainty in your customer behavior? Clearly, putting up good double-digit RPO backlog
was good to see. But what are your thoughts on what you're seeing in your pipeline?
Robin L. Washington
President, Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Director
Yes. Brent, I'll reiterate what Miguel said. We do have this overall balanced portfolio. So we were able to
think about that relative to our guidance and the puts and takes of knowing what we know today. It's been
helpful to us. We also have the strong momentum, as you've heard us talk about with data and AI. So we
have a modest contribution from Agentforce, but we see that to be a continued needle mover. We've been
-- factored in the headwinds, but overall, that plus the FX change gives us a lot of confidence in where we
stand today. You also heard Miguel talk about the AE capacity that will ramp and be available for second
half.
So we feel really good. We're excited about our products. We're excited about our capacity. And as you
heard us talk about, our options to grow are in line with what we believe is the ability to deliver on our
guidance.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Perfect. The main highlight for me, if I look through the numbers this quarter, was the strength in
platform. And Marc, you talked about Tableau. Can you talk a little bit about how that combined portfolio
of Tableau, MuleSoft, Informatica is kind of going to change the game for you around agent and the whole
company?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, I think you're really onto something because -- I'm going to ask Srini to come in here also. I think
that, number one, was you were at the Tableau conference. You really saw this incredible now Tableau.
But one of the things about -- that's powerful about the Tableau, not does it only have the agentic layer,
not only is it integrated now -- deeply integrated into our Data Cloud, but it's deeply integrated in our
metadata platform, and it runs on Hyperforce.
And I'll tell you that if you're using Slack now, you'll see Tableau's appearing within that. If you're using
our core applications, Tableau is now appearing within that. And Tableau is now part and parcel with our
core functionality and kind of the core components of every other part of Salesforce. So I'm super excited
about that.
We also went through a pretty big transformation on distribution with Tableau where our Tableau sales
leaders who were basically what we call prime account executives, that they're kind of independent,
on the side, running as their own kind of sales organization, they're now deeply integrated into our
distribution organization where all of our salespeople are now selling Tableau as a core part of our product
line. And those distribution leaders are now supporting them in what we call kind of a co-prime position.
But I'll tell you that this idea that Tableau and the new Tableau or really all of our products built on this
ADAM framework is really being led by Srini as our Chief Engineering Officer. Srini also runs customer
support. He also runs professional services. And Srini also runs South Asia, which includes everywhere
SALESFORCE, INC. FQ1 2026 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 28, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
from Singapore, including Thailand, Malaysia and all the South Asian countries and all of India as well,
including our Indian engineering operations. So Srini, would you like to come in and kind of fill that in?
Srinivas Tallapragada
President, Chief Engineering & Customer Success Officer
Yes. Thank you, Marc. So I think the -- I would still frame the bigger point as Agentforce is everybody
wants to do agents. This is a new thing. Every customer talk starts and ends with talking about
Agentforce. And that's our digital labor platform for the enterprise, and it's built on this deeply unified
enterprise scale, trusted, open and metadata platform. But all Agentforce is tied to the data strategy.
And if you really think of data strategy, this is what -- Data Cloud is very important. It unifies and
activates data with zero copy. MuleSoft is very important. It connects all your apps and systems to
manage those APIs because that's what the agents need. And then Tableau turns all those insights built on
this ADAM framework into action, and that's where the energy is.
And of course, Informatica will now accelerate -- will help us accelerate and expand our data strategy. So
this enterprise-grade data platform with MuleSoft, Data Cloud, Tableau and in the future, with Informatica
gives enterprises a really trusted data platform, which is what is required to really make the promise of
agents true because that's what people wanted, trusted agent, which is scaling, which they can trust,
which is -- really delivers the value. And the work we have been doing for the last of 3.5, 4 years right
from the database layer, right from Hyperforce, then we got all the data layer, rewriting everything in the
ADAM framework is what people are now seeing it.
And as Marc referred, when we did the Tableau conference, the DataFam was really thrilled because now
they see not just themselves as just visualizing new -- and providing insights but also as Agentblazers.
They see this future where they can be part of building agents and bring it all together. So that's where
how this is all coming together.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.
Bradley Hartwell Sills
BofA Securities, Research Division
We certainly are hearing the same success that you're describing in the Agentforce cycle amongst channel
partners. Marc, I wanted to ask you a question around some of the indicators that you're paying attention
to that give you the comfort that this cycle is going to be material for the company.
Is it simply these Data Cloud deals that you're seeing the momentum there as customers load the data
there? Some of these pilot deals you referred to, what are some of the leading indicators that you're
looking to that suggest that this is a big cycle coming?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, it's a great question. And I think we have to just kind of get right back to the beginning, which is
you can kind of look at these earnings calls and like a year ago, we weren't really even -- I don't think the
word agent was even on our earnings call a year ago. Maybe it wasn't even on our earnings call 9 months
ago.
But it started to appear, and when we released the product end of October, it's November, December,
January, February, March, April, here we are in May. So just think about in a relatively short period of
time, I've never seen in my career over 45 years in enterprise software this idea that we now have 8,000
customers, 4,000 of whom are paying, many of them who have dense scale deployments where this is
working in months.
It just makes no sense actually to me. Obviously, most of these products and these technologies like Data
Cloud or look at any of our core apps or Hyperforce or all the things that Srini has built, the Miguel has
SALESFORCE, INC. FQ1 2026 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 28, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
sold, what the company has put together, these things take years, not months, not days, night weeks. So
we're moving very, very fast.
I think one of the most important things, and I think Miguel can really speak to this, and I'll have him
do that at the end of this, is that when we sell an Agentforce, we're not just dropping some box off and
saying, okay, we sold an Agentforce. We're pulling all of our clouds in. And I'm sure that you heard like,
for example, in the example I think of Pepsi, they have 11 of our clouds.
So when we're pulling in Agentforce, where all the other products are coming along with it, now obviously,
Agentforce and Data Cloud are absolutely deeply unified and connected, but Agentforce and Data Cloud
are deeply integrated and connected to every single one of our products. This is a huge transformation
that we have created just in the last 2 years.
So 2 years ago when we went through our huge financial transformation, we also decided maybe
aggressively to also go through a huge innovation transformation. And we have rewritten all of our
apps, all of our Data Cloud, and created an agentic layer and Hyperforce and brought it all together as
one unified platform. And 2 years ago, it was just not there. It's one of the reasons why we feel very
comfortable right now acquiring Informatica because we can see how it can radically extend what we have
done, complement it. It's incredibly additive. This ability to harmonize all of this data, it just is going to
make everything better for our customers and give this platform that we have a lot more capability.
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
Maybe, Marc, I'll comment on the non-stand-alone nature of Agentforce as a reference. We took all the
deals, all the Agentforce deals for the quarter. On average, there were 4 other clouds on those deals. Also,
as Robin referred earlier, 1/3 of our top 100 deals, including both Agentforce and Data Cloud, but I look at
the top 6, the top 6, which on average, $34 million of TCV on average on each of them.
On those 6, 5 of them have Data Cloud as an anchor and also Agentforce as an anchor. The 1 customer
that didn't buy, the top 6 on Data Cloud is because they bought in Q4 a multimillion-dollar deal Data
Cloud. They set the data foundation before they went to adding more clouds and Agentforce. On the top 6
on Agentforce, on the top 6 deals, 5 bought Agentforce. The one that didn't buy is the one that, Srini, you
know very well. We are negotiating now the extension to Agentforce. So it's kind of magic.
But going back to Brad's -- also a question he was referring, okay, what are you really focused on, the
reality is, Brad, we're not focused that much on how many more Agentforce deals or Data Cloud. That
motion is on fire. We had 3x more Data Cloud deals in Q1 than we had the year before. We have also, I
mean, infinite numbers more of Agentforce deals because we didn't have Agentforce last year. What we
have focused on very much is on consumption. This is a new game.
By the way, this consumption motion is bringing the company really tied together from finance to product
with Steve Fisher, with engineering, [ Dave Meyer ]; with engineering with Srini, the whole company and
go to market is really aligned together behind consumption. I mean my role has changed totally. When
I sell, my job starts. And we have huge consumption. We have 22 trillion records ingested, 8 of them
through zero copy, which is the fantastic innovation. And as Robin referred earlier on Agentforce, already
30 customers came back and refilled the tank.
Very exciting. But now that we are touching on the consumption topic, Srini, you've helped me a lot. You
come up with this initiative of forward deployed engineers. Can you elaborate a bit more on that?
Srinivas Tallapragada
President, Chief Engineering & Customer Success Officer
Yes. So I think in my new role as including customer success and professional services, as Marc
mentioned, I think I'm really obsessed with customer success. Two things, correct? When a new product
comes in, which is transforming so much, the iteration, the feedback loop between product, engineering,
customer success, go to market has to be very tight. So the way we have done is we have created, thanks
to our Customer Zero initiative on support where Agentforce is handling a lot of things.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18
We use some of -- first of all, we use some of those resources to create this forward deployment
engineering team. And we're working with a lot of customers hand in hand every day. They're making
changes every day to really get the consumption group going and really get the product maturity.
And I see 3 types of customers. We have customers who are in the expansion phase. They got the
first customer. These are 30% additional ACV that Miguel talked about. And what are they asking?
They're saying they got the first customer live. And they are the people who said, "Hey, I really like your
conversation, but now I really want to expand. I need a better pricing strategy." This is what we listened
and created this new action-based pricing strategy.
They also have day 2 concerns. They're saying, "Hey, I -- now I want to expand it more. I want
observability. I wanted the improvement loop." So a lot of our product features, we're adding with that.
Then, we have customers in -- just in a pilot. They got a first pilot. They are now figuring out how do I get
-- improve my data estates. They're becoming -- data is becoming very critical. Actually, that is what also
was driving some of our strategy almost every customer I talk to. There is Informatica there. This is also
tied to that, why we are talking about data is very important.
They are asking things like setup and determination. They want tools, so we created a testing center. How
do you tread because these are all not predictive systems? These are stochastic systems. It's not like
regular. So you don't -- they have -- the models are changing, so they need trust.
And then everybody -- and this is a broader level, which is enterprise. They want latency. What happens
-- say, one of these model providers go down. How do I do local residency? How do I provide auditability?
I think we are taking all of these features, and we created these forward deployment teams, deployed
engineers, we call, where in a tight loop, not just with Salesforce but also with a lot of our partners like
Accenture, Deloitte and all and neuroflash and customers like that and really improving it.
I think we are at very early stages. We are super excited. We're obsessed about customer success, and
the name of the game is to mature the product, really focus on customer success and iterate the maturity.
And I think they're learning a lot of things, and that's what we're doing. Almost we're releasing product
features almost every day.
Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer
This is a learning journey, and we are learning at the biggest scale of any vendor right now across every
industry, across every geography, across every segment. And this tight feedback loop is very important.
Thank you, Srini.

Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.
Brad Alan Zelnick
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I echo my congrats. Marc, with AI and Agentforce advancing quicker than anything we've ever seen, I
have to imagine the use cases you're seeing today versus even 90 days ago or blowing you away. What
can you tell us about what lies on the leading edge in terms of applications, impact on ROI of Agentforce
and how Data Cloud fits into that?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, I really just have to look directly to these stories with these customers. And as I travel the world,
and I'll tell you that, again, we've talked about the speed of which Agentforce is gone, but it's not just a
U.S. phenomenon. It's an international phenomenon. And as I mentioned last week, I was in Japan, and
one of our customers in Japan, Fujitsu, is really doing some amazing things. But when I heard at the rate
and scale and speed that they want to deploy the product, and their vision in terms of how it can be all
encompassing for an agentic layer around the entire company, I really just could not believe it.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 19
I really sat with 5 of the largest Japanese companies. And I think somehow every company's imagination
has been captured that they have this idea that they can build an agentic layer around their company.
So of course, we've been very focused for many years on the customer opportunity, what we've been
calling Customer 360. We've deployed that so well. In recent years, we've also been incredibly excited
about what's happened with Slack and how we've gone across the enterprise. And then in addition to that,
we've built this massive data business. Now that's really 3 different businesses that we're in. We're in our
customer business. We're in the Slack business, which is the enterprise-wide business. And we're in this
incredible data business. Now of course, we're also doing that by vertical.
All right. When we look at that then, when we combine that with this agentic and AI and data capability,
that's where I really think that it starts to come together in this really powerful and very meaningful way.
And that is what I see over and over and over again.
And I think another really good example is kind of really -- we kind of already got into it once before, but
I'll just mention it. I was very surprised when I was seeing this demonstration of Smartsheet. And all of
a sudden, when we're using the product, and it's obviously -- for those of you who know, it's like a cloud
version of Excel, very popular. I think it's got like 13 million users. A lot of you use it. A lot of you have the
technology, cover the company. But all of a sudden, right inside Smartsheet itself, Agentforce is already
now in place.
And the customer is able to not only get support but also to add additional users or change key provisions
with their licenses. This idea that agents are kind of starting to provision to become digital labor, this is
exceeding my expectation that it crosses industries. It's crossing geographies. And as I said, all of this is
really just happening in only 6 months.
By the time we get to Dreamforce, which is still another 6 months ahead, I expect another huge massive
transformation. We're starting to cut the code right now on what will be one of the main releases of
Dreamforce. And when we look at what will come as the release after Dreamforce, our technology, our
product doesn't look at all like what it looked like just a few months ago. So we're moving very, very fast.
And I think that I really would say this hasn't really happened too many times in the last 30, 40 years. The
rate of innovation far exceeds the rate of customer adoption.
The amount of technology, the value that we're able to deliver to a customer is just phenomenal, which
is why I have a real fever about expanding our distribution organization, especially in these markets,
geographies and segments that are just growing at incredible rates. But for a lot of reasons that have to
do with our financial transformation, in the last 24 to 36 months, we have not grown those distribution in
the segments that we're growing. It wasn't a mistake that we were making. It was very mindful. We knew
that we were slowing down growth, but we were accelerating margin and cash flow.
Now our challenge is very simple. We're going to grow our margin. We're going to grow our cash flow, but
we are going to grow our revenue. And the way that we're going to do it is exactly what Miguel and Srini
and Robin said. We're going to invest at scale into the markets that are growing very dramatically. And
we know where they are. We're there. We're seeing the -- whether it's by geography or whether it's by
market segment. That is whether it's by key markets that have grown incredibly since the pandemic like
Japan or Latin America or even markets in the United States like the tech industry, okay?
But where we have not invested distribution capability, we will invest aggressively what we already have.
And then we will also build and create incredible new products and value for those segments as well. And
we will also acquire like we did last year with Own. That's been, by the way, an incredible success story.
So I think we have a good handle on, one, how to deliver the numbers that all of our investors want;
and two, deliver this incredible growth by focusing on geography, segments and product and technology
capabilities where the markets are really expanding.

Great start to the fiscal year. I'll keep my questions relatively brief since we're towards the end of the call.
Marc, one for you. Obviously, Agentforce is off to a smashing success. You are at 4,000 paid customers.
When you look at consumer adoption of generative AI, you've got ChatGPT at 500 million users. The
adoption there seems to be off the charts. So what is holding the enterprise back? What are your view as
something that led the cloud cycle? What in your view are 2 or 3 maybe unblocks that you could bring to
bear, so you could have 100,000 Agentforce customers versus the 4,000 you have today?
And one for Robin. Congratulations on taking over the new position. I just want to clarify the time duration
when you expect Informatica to be accretive. Is that -- so you closed the deal early calendar '26, and it is
going to be accretive to calendar '27. If that's the case, why that long? And why not sooner? How could it
be sooner?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Okay. Well, Kash, I'm so glad you answered the question or asked the question because I'll tell you that
we've talked about this before. We've answered this question before, but I want to come back and hit it
one more time and then really kind of come in and really explain what it is our strategy is and also the
huge progress that we've made, but you're -- and then the incredible opportunity ahead for everybody.
Number one, when we all are using ChatGPT or Gemini, or You.com or Perplexity or Anthropic or any
of these models or an open source model or DeepSeek, okay, all of these models are mostly the same.
They're within 3 to 6 months of innovation of each other. We all know that. And then all these models are
trained on mostly the same data sets because there's only so much data that they can be trained on.
Now there's some synthetic data, but it doesn't mean very much to a lot of these models. That's why, by
the way, that these models still have not improved a lot of their accuracy in the consumer side. And you
can see those numbers. Those benchmarks are very clear. So what happens is you have these advances in
these algorithms. Models are just algorithms. And then you have these amalgamated data sets, which are
kind of manufactured off of the Internet data.
And then all of a sudden, you get this kind of working model, and it's kind of like super search. We all have
this experience. It's like prompt engineering. We'll write the prompt and we get the answer. And we used
to search on Google and now we're searching through one of these models. So it could be a model that
Google has, Gemini, or it could be another model, like you mentioned, ChatGPT or it could be another
model, Anthropic, et cetera, or DeepSeek. And you're searching. You get the results. So why is that not,
boom, an accelerator -- automatic accelerator for everything you can do in the enterprise?
And of course, we can all talk to Microsoft about that, who came in and said that it would be 2 years ago
or 3 years ago now with the Copilot and how that was going to supercharge everything, and it turned
out that, that was a false prophecy because that's not how the enterprise works. The enterprise has data
sets that are highly controlled, highly governed and highly secured. And these data sets are everything
from your customer data set to your financial data set to your HR data set, and the reality is that on -- all
enterprise data is available to all users.
Like, for example, you work, Kash, at Goldman Sachs. You can't see all the Goldman Sachs customer
information. There's regulations around that. You can't see all the employees' salary information. You
don't have access to all the Goldman Sachs financial data. So when you're using these models, they're
not just giving you access to all of this stuff. Are they, Kash? No, they have to be tightly controlled. But
if I'm a Goldman Sachs customer, and I want to come in and I want to ask about my account balance or
information about my -- who I am and what my portfolio looks like or what my opportunities are or even if
I'm a Goldman Sachs employee and I want information on -- the general information on benefits or how to
enable myself or how to sell products more efficiently to customers, all of those things could easily happen
right now with the agentic platform.
However, there's a lot of things that could not happen as I kind of just amplified, and that is kind of
the constraint. So what is it going to take to get this transformation to happen, where we have a much

bigger agentic wrapper around Goldman Sachs, your company, or around all companies? We'll look at my
company to start. I think we've probably done the best of maybe any tech company. We've done now --
this quarter, we'll pass through 1 million conversations and customer support. It's a dramatic reduction
in the amount of human beings who have had to get involved to answer customers' issues. I don't think
any other tech company at scale has delivered this capability. It is a proof point without any doubt that
Salesforce has been able to deliver on its vision of digital labor, and Agentforce is #1, Customer Zero,
Salesforce. So we eat our own dog food, and this is amazing.
By the way, compare that to other big tech companies like Microsoft and others who have tried to do that,
but they don't have this kind of same velocity and capability. They haven't had this kind of ability because
they don't have this approach.
Now part of it is we're lucky because we are built on our Customer 360. We're built on our Service Cloud.
We're built on our Sales Cloud. We're built on our Marketing Cloud. So when we look at those things, then
we can say at a high level, "Hey, Marketing Cloud, wow, you're doing 1 trillion e-mails. How do you take
-- those are one-way conversations. How do you make those 2-way conversations?" That's the agentic
opportunity.
And today, for our customers, they all want to get there. They all have the hunger to do that. They all
want to have this great success, but it takes some time for them to start to build their data sets. And that
is why the Informatica acquisition is so important because they all need to not only translate their data to
build their master data management. They need to harmonize their data. They need to do all these things.
And we see that and we go into these customers and like, "Let's go." And they're like, "We can do some,
but we can't do all." And the reason they can't do all is because their whole enterprise data set is not fully
harmonized, which is why Informatica is so critical now more than ever.
And look, Informatica is a small company. They don't have the distribution scale that we have. They have
like a -- I'm not going to tell you what the size of their distribution organization because it's probably
covered under my NDA, but it isn't -- it's orders of magnitude less than Salesforce. I'll tell you that. So
that idea that we have the ability to really go out there and start to sell that product to all companies
worldwide to really show them that they need this for this capability.
Now this is why I have this fever about growing, like Miguel said, our distribution organization by more
than 20% this year, because we've held back for the last 36 months. On our -- and we've never done
that in our history, but we did it because of the financial transformation that we wanted to go through. So
we've done that. But it just now is just coinciding perfectly with this technology transformation that we're
going through, which indeed is a data transformation, and that is what's going on.
So when we ask a question like you said, well, ChatGPT, Gemini. Well, you know Anthropic. Well, you
know DeepSeek. Well, you know Perplexity. Well, you know You.com. They're "tadadada", but these
are packaged, highly controlled consumer experiences. This is not what you have and you understand
the enterprise experience very well, Kash, because you're a top enterprise analyst. But at Goldman
Sachs, that's not how it's going to roll. And when we work with Goldman Sachs or we work with another
bank, like we've probably told you, we've already deployed at a lot of banks that this idea that we
can do this, but it does require very significant and critical, the governance, the security, reliability,
availability capability of an enterprise -- a company like Salesforce. And the proof point is here, me,
help.salesforce.com.
And we are going to do that for all companies, but we're going to do it through Slack. We're going to do
it through Tableau. We're going to do it in help. We're going to do it every product we have, and we're
going to do it with -- through an agentic layer, through a data layer, through an app layer and through
a metadata layer, and we're going to bring these 4 things together and dramatically transform every
company we do business with whether they're small, medium, large or extra-large just like Miguel went
through.

Yes. And Kash, to your other question, timing of close of Informatica as well as time to accretion, subject
to regulatory approval, we expect that it's going to close beginning of our fiscal year '27, which is February
of next year, so February '26. The framework that we've talked about when we look at deals, we assume
can we get it accretive within 2 years, right? So that's kind of our goal. Our desire is always to under
promise and over deliver.
I think with our playbook that we have in place. We're going to go fast as possible. We're really focused on
accelerating integration. So we'll see how that works out. But overall, that framework is the 2-year period
that I provided to accretion.

Your last question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.
Mark Ronald Murphy
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Marc, the CEO of Anthropic recently commented that AI could wipe out 50% of entry-level white-collar
jobs and drive unemployment a lot higher, unfortunately. And since you've been very astute and very
ahead of the curve on commoditization of LLMs and you've been very outspoken on the topic of digital
labor, I'm curious just to get your thoughts on that concept. And how do you think Salesforce could help
companies navigate whatever changes coming our way while maintaining a human touch or human
oversight that might be required?
Marc R. Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, I think it's a great question, and I think we all believe in the division of digital labor. And I think I've
laid out the case with help.salesforce.com and given you the metrics. And so those employees, though,
are really getting, I would say, repositioned in our company in other areas. That is we really have -- we
have so much opportunity. I can't hire as many people as I want right now.
So I'm hiring. I'm very excited. I'm trying to grow distribution, as I mentioned. I have -- I'm deploying -- I
have 4 deployed engineers I'm trying to hire. I have account executives I'm trying to hire. I am doing -- I
have a lot of opportunity throughout the world, and that is held back by, wow, there isn't a lot of people to
hire. It's actually surprising. So that is kind of the interesting point.
And we've all read this paper, for example, AI 2027, which is 2 years away. And when I talk to a lot of my
friends, they're like, oh, well, this is my vision exactly of what's going to happen. And I'm like the selfreplicating rocket ships are not quite here yet. I don't know if you've read this book, We Are Legion (We
Are Bob), but it's kind of a phenomenon here in Silicon Valley that all these CEOs are reading this one
book saying, yes, this is exactly what's going to happen, which kind of what yielded Sam Altman's tweet
last week.
And we're not exactly at that point where the computer is completely conscious, has human consciousness
and to the point where it's running its own manufacturing facilities, creating its own rocket ships and
launching itself into the planet. And to that point, we aren't exactly even to that point yet where all these
white-collar jobs are just suddenly disappearing because I think that we realize why AI can do some
things. While this is very exciting in the enterprise, we all know it cannot do everything. And it doesn't
have the accuracy yet because it's built on a word model.
And word models are inherently not 100% accurate because of the way that the computer science works,
where it's, as you all know, this word, that word, this word and then therefore, it's this other word,
and there's this kind of matrix between this word and all the other words. But when you look at it, the
mathematics don't work out to be 100% accurate. It's in the math, is hallucinogens, which is why people
say, oh, the hallucinogenics are a feature because it's not going away with that model. We are going to
have to have other models that are going to have to come in the future, world models or multi-century
models or other things. But AI is a continuum, and we're not totally there yet.

And in terms of the amount of white-collar jobs that are going to disappear, you're all experts at this
point in the current generation of AI. You're using it every day. We're all using it. It doesn't matter
who I speak to. Probably all of your children, all of your family members are using it, and you can see
how it's impacted. Like people are smarter. They get their medical labs. They ask, "Well, what do you
think about this?" But then when you call your doctor, sometimes the doctor goes, "Well, actually, that's
not completely true." And we're kind of at this point where it's very good on some things but not for
everything. And because of that, even in the enterprise, while there's a lot of things that we can do, edit
this press release or write me this speech or whatever, but the reality is, oh, you're probably still going to
want to get in there and work on it. And I think we all know that.
So look, we're at an exciting moment in AI, and maybe we're moving into this world where there's
going to be like these AI prophets and obviously, I'm a huge fan of Dario's. He's great, amazing person,
incredible company, wonderful. But some of these comments, I think, are alarmist and get a little
aggressive in the current form of AI today. Not that it's not a great company. And by the way, Salesforce is
a huge investor in Anthropic. We love the company, love Dario. We have embedded it into Slack. It's how
Slack does its recap and a lot of its little magical things that happen like talking to you in your channels.
But it's not at that point. And that's kind of why I've said like Copilot is kind of the new Clippy in a lot of
ways because, yes, you can do some things, but it's kind of got overhyped. And we need to show you
what you really can do, how you really can transform your enterprise, how the magic is -- really can
happen.
And by the way, if you haven't used Tableau Next, this is the best example where you're using Tableau. We
all know Tableau. We've loved it. We've used it for 20 years. But now there's an agent there with you and
that it's on a data cloud and it's integrated with Slack and all these other things. It's amazing. And that
amazing part is what we're going to do more of and -- but we're not ready to like, I think, take the action
that Dario suggested. I hope that, that answered your question.
