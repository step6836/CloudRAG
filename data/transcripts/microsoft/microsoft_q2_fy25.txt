Actual results could materially differbecause of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in thecomments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of
our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty toupdate any forward-looking statement.And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.SATYA NADELLA:Thank you, Brett.This quarter, we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, whichsurpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year-over-year.Enterprises are beginning to move from proof-of-concepts to enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI.And our AI business has now surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13billion, up 175% year-over-year.Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the corethesis behind our approach to how we manage our fleet, and how weallocate our capital to compute.AI scaling laws are continuing to compound across both pre-training andinference-time compute.We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both trainingand inference for years now.
On inference, we have typically seen more than 2X price-performance gainfor every hardware generation, and more than 10X for every modelgeneration due to software optimizations.And, as AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentiallymore demand.Therefore, much as we have done with the commercial cloud, we arefocused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the rightbalance across training and inference, as well as geo distribution.From now on, it is a more continuous cycle governed by both revenuegrowth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects ofsoftware-driven AI scaling laws and Moore’s law.With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layerof the tech stack.Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our datacenter capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals.We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the lastthree years. And we have added more capacity last year than any other yearin our history.Our datacenters, networks, racks, and silicon are all coming together as acomplete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloudworkloads of today and the next-gen AI workloads.
We continue to take advantage of Moore’s law and refresh our fleet, asevidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, as well asour first party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost, and HSM.When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBSmove workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloadsencompassing nearly 400 billion records and two petabytes of data.And, we remain the cloud of choice for customers’ mission critical Oracle,SAP, and VMWare apps.At the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric break out. We now haveover 19,000 paid customers, from Hitachi to Johnson Controls, to Schaeffler.Fabric is now the fastest growing analytics product in our history.Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric, with over 30 million monthlyactive users, up 40% since last year.Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI driven data patterns emerge. If youlook underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or Enterprise AI apps you see thegrowth of raw storage, database services and App platform services asthese workloads scale.The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azureapp services more than doubled year-over-year, driving significant growthin adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB.Now, on to AI platforms and tools.
As we shared last week, we are thrilled OpenAI has made new large Azurecommitments.Through our strategic partnership, we continue to benefit mutually fromeach other’s growth.And with OpenAI’s APIs exclusively running on Azure, customers can counton us to get access to the world’s leading models.And OpenAI has a lot more coming soon. So, Stay tuned.Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, runtimes to build agentsand multi-agent apps, AI ops, and API access to thousands of models.Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users.And we are well positioned with our support of both OpenAI’s leadingmodels and the best selection of open-source models and SLMs.DeepSeek’s R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry andGitHub, with automated red teaming, content safety integration, andsecurity scanning.Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times.And we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige.AI,Rockwell Automation, Siemens to address industry-specific use cases.With AI, how we build, deploy, and maintain code is fundamentallychanging.
And GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital nativeslike ASOS and Spotify, as well as the world’s largest enterprises like HP,HSBC, and KPMG.We have been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot in VSCode, with more than a million signups in just the first week post-launch.All-up, GitHub is now home to 150 million developers, up 50% over thepast two years.Now, on to the future of work.Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI.It helps supercharge employee productivity, and provides access to aswarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow.We are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes, as wewin new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of existingenterprise customers come back to purchase more seats.When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during its first quarterof availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than 10Xover the past 18 months.To share just one example: Novartis has added thousands of seats eachquarter over the past year, and now has 40,000 seats.
Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson, and the University of Miami all purchased10,000 or more seats this quarter.And, overall, the number of people who use Copilot daily again more thandoubled quarter-over-quarter.Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensityincreased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter.And we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat, which was announcedearlier this month.Copilot Chat, along with Copilot Studio, is now available to every employeeto start using agents right in the flow of work.With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is tocreate an Excel spreadsheet.More than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio, andthey collectively created more than 400,000 custom agents in the last threemonths alone, up over 2X quarter-over-quarter.We have also introduced our own first party agents to facilitate meetings,manage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries, and accessSharePoint data.And we also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, andWorkday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot.
What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI, as well as our momentum withagents, is our rich data cloud, which is the world’s largest source oforganizational knowledge.Billions of e-mails, documents, and chats, hundreds of millions of Teamsmeetings, and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day.This is the enterprise knowledge cloud, and it’s growing fast, up over 25%year-over-year.More broadly, what we are seeing is Copilot, plus agents, disruptingbusiness applications.And we are leaning into this.With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo,RTX, Total Energies, and Vizient switched to our AI-powered apps fromlegacy providers.In healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician-patientencounters, up 54% quarter-over-quarter.It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, MichiganMedicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase the productivityof their physicians.When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as weapproach end-of-support for Windows 10.
Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhancedsecurity and advanced AI capabilities.15% of premium-priced laptops in the US this holiday were Copilot+ PCs,and we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to beCopilot+ PCs.We also see more and more developers, from Adobe and CapCut, toWhatsApp, build apps that leverage built-in NPUs.And they will soon be able to run DeepSeek’s R1 distilled models locally onCopilot+ PCs, as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows.And beyond Copilot+ PCs, the most powerful AI workstation for localdevelopment is a Windows PC running WSL 2 powered by NVIDIA RTXGPUs.Now, on to security.We continue to make progress with our Secure Future Initiative.And we are applying what we have learned, introducing over 80 newproduct capabilities over the past year.With Security Copilot, organizations across the private and public sector,like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa Sanpaolo, National AustraliaBank, and NTT, can resolve incidents 30% faster.
Data governance is increasingly critical, and customers have now usedMicrosoft Purview to audit over two billion Copilot interactions for safe andcompliant use.Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn.More professionals than ever are engaging in high-value conversations onLinkedIn, with comments up 37% year-over-year.Short-form video continues to grow on the platform, with video creationall-up growing at twice the rate of other post formats.We’re also innovating with agents to help recruiters and small businessesfind qualified candidates faster. And our hiring business again took share.In subscriptions, LinkedIn Premium surpassed $2 billion in annual revenuefor the first time this quarter.Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years, andnearly 40% of subscribers have used our AI features to improve theirprofiles.And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions remains the leader in B2B advertising.Now, on to Search, Advertising and News.We once again took share across Bing and Edge.Edge surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows, and has takenshare for 15 consecutive quarters.
The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off,and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform tooptimize ROI.And our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement andretention, with its improved speed, unique personality, first-of-its-kindfeatures like Copilot Vision.Just today we made Think Deeper, powered by o1, free for all Copilot usersglobally.Now, on to gaming.We are focused on improving the profitability of the business, in order toposition it for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content andplatform services.And we are delivering on this plan.Black Ops 6 was the top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter– and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release infranchise history.And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which hasalready been played by more than 4 million people.We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with arecord 140 million hours streamed this quarter.
All-up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PCsubscriber base by over 30%, as we focus on driving fully-paid subscribersacross endpoints.In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help ourcustomers in this AI era.And I am energized by the many opportunities ahead.With that, let me turn it over to Amy.AMY HOOD:Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was$69.6 billion, up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% inconstant currency while operating income increased 17% and 16% inconstant currency. And earnings per share was $3.23, an increase of 10%.We delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth.Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings whilewe also improved our operating leverage with higher-than-expectedoperating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annualrevenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above expectations.Commercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency andwere significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitmentsfrom OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions
with growth in the number of 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for bothAzure and Microsoft 365.Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up34% and 36% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized inrevenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remainingportion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 45%. And thisquarter, our annuity mix was 97%.FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in linewith expectations on total company revenue, More Personal Computingrevenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreasedrevenue more than expected in our commercial segments.Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%. Microsoft Cloudgross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations, and decreased2 points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure.Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to69% primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as wellas improvement in Gaming and Search, partially offset by the impact ofscaling our AI infrastructure.Operating expenses increased 5%, lower than expected, and operatingmargins increased 2 points year-over-year to 45%. The better-thanexpected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across ourbusinesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications.
At a total company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% higherthan a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter.Now to our segment results.Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.4 billion andgrew 14% and 13% in constant currency even with the unfavorable FXimpact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations driven byMicrosoft 365 commercial.M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constantcurrency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expectedperformance in E5 and M365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue tosee growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. ARPU growth was againdriven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments,though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline workerofferings.M365 commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead ofexpectations driven by higher-than-expected transactional purchasing withthe launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows Commercial on-premisescomponents from the better-than-expected performance of M365 suitesnoted earlier.
M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead ofexpectations. We saw continued momentum in M365 consumersubscriptions which grew 10% to 86.3 million with mix shift to M365 Basic.LinkedIn revenue increased 9% with continued growth across all lines ofbusiness. In our Talent Solutions business, results were slightly belowexpectations driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in keyverticals.Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency,slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all workloads.Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currencyand gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year driven byscaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% andoperating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency.Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.5 billion and grew19% with more unfavorable FX impact than expected. Excluding theunfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-prem server,and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected,partially offset by better-than-expected results in Azure AI services.Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year over year and was aheadof expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our availablecapacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected
due to go-to-market execution challenges, particularly with our customersthat we primarily reach through our scale motions, as we balance drivingnear-term non-AI consumption with AI growth.In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly belowexpectations driven by slower-than-expected purchasing around WindowsServer 2025 launch.Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1%, below expectationswith lower-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Servicesand Industry Solutions.Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currencyand gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year-over-year driven byscaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10% andoperating income grew 14%.Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relativelyunchanged year-over-year with better-than-expected results drivenprimarily by Windows OEM pre-builds, usage from a third-party partnershipin Search, as well as Call of Duty launch performance in Gaming.Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 4% year-over-year, ahead ofexpectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows10 end of support as well as uncertainty around tariffs.
Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% inconstant currency, ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion andhealthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing.And in Gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency ascontent and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines.Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectationsdriven by stronger-than-expected performance in Blizzard and Activisioncontent, including Call of Duty.Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency.Gross margin percentage increased 6 points year-over-year driven by salesmix shift to higher margin businesses as well as strong execution on marginimprovement in Gaming and Search.Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased 32% and30% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of highermargin opportunities.Now back to total company results.Capital expenditures including finance leases were $22.6 billion, in line withexpectations, and cash paid for P, P, and E was $15.8 billion. More than halfof our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will supportmonetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and
AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customersbased on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog.Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18% driven by strong cloudbillings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee, andtax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year-over-year,reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier.This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3 billion, lowerthan our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our Cruiseinvestment.Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%.And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends andshare repurchases.Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise,is on a US dollar basis.First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we nowexpect FX to decrease total revenue growth by two points. Within thesegments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by two points inProductivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly onepoint in More Personal Computing. When compared to our Octoberguidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue
of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth byapproximately two points and operating expense growth by approximatelyone point.Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue thru Q3.Demand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the MicrosoftCloud should drive another quarter of strong growth.In commercial bookings, with a relatively flat expiry base and a strong prioryear comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to beroughly flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our coreannuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to ourplatform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are moreunpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in ourbookings growth rate.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%, downyear-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.Next to segment guidance.In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue to grow between11% and 12% in constant currency, or $29.4 to $29.7 billion.M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be between 14% and 15%in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better-than-
expected Q2 results. We expect continued ARPU growth thru E5 and M365Copilot and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the sizeof the installed base.For M365 commercial products, we expect revenue to be relativelyunchanged year-over-year. As a reminder, M365 commercial productsinclude Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites soour quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-periodrevenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high singledigits driven by M365 subscriptions.For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits.Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in TalentSolutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth.And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teensdriven by continued growth across all workloads.For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% inconstant currency, or $25.9 to $26.2 billion.Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can havequarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognitiondepending on the mix of contracts.
In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% inconstant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. Aswe shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow fromincreased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services healthy growthcontinues, although we expect ongoing impact thru H2 as we work toaddress the execution challenges noted earlier. And while we expect to beAI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY25 we should be roughly inline with near-term demand given our significant capital investments.In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in themid-single digits driven by a decrease in transactional purchasing.And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be inthe low to mid-single digits.In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 to $12.8billion with continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities.Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-singledigits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year-over-year as our outlook assumes inventory levels will normalize. Actualresults may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue willdecline.Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-teens from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search withshare gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to moderate from
last quarter primarily due to additional FX impact and as the third-partypartnership usage noted earlier returns to more normal levels. Search ex-TAC growth will be higher than overall Search and news advertisingrevenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high single digits.And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits.We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low tomid-single digits driven by first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass.Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year.Now back to company guidance.We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or tobe between $21.65 to $21.85 billion and operating expense to growbetween 5% and 6% in constant currency or to be between $16.4 and $16.5billion.Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billionprimarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. Asa reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equitymethod investments.And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.Now some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond.
First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we nowexpect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than onepoint and operating expense growth by roughly one point.Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 toremain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY26, we expect to continueinvesting against strong demand signals including customer contractedbacklog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our MicrosoftCloud. However, the growth rate will be lower than FY25 and the mix ofspend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets which are morecorrelated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructureinvestments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customerdemand globally across our Microsoft Cloud including AI workloads. Asalways, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructurebuildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases.For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue andoperating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across bothCOGS and operating expense. And, given the operating leverage that we’vedelivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale ourAI infrastructure and utilize our own AI solutions, we now expect FY25operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year.And finally, our FY25 full year effective tax rate should be between 18% and19%.
In closing, we are committed to delivering real world AI solutions that helpcustomers grow and improve their results. We are confident in ourleadership position as we grow with our customers.Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Brett Iversen ismoving to a new role here as the head of our Americas sales finance team.On behalf of the company, thank you for your tremendous impact leadingInvestor Relations for the past 4 years and for the partnership with bothSatya and me. And I’d like to welcome Jonathan Neilson, the former headof finance for our Security products, who is returning to Investor Relationsto lead the team.With that, let’s go to Q&A, Brett.BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out ofrespect for others on the call, we request the participants please only askone question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?(Operator Direction.)KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking thequestion and echoing Amy’s comments, Brett, congratulations on the newrole. It’s been a pleasure working with you, and best of luck in that newrole.
Looking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes tocommercial bookings, but again, we were a little bit disappointed on Azurecoming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping youcould dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what theresolution to those issues were. And do we still feel comfortable in theacceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about afterthe June quarter and after last quarter? Thank you very much.AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith. Let me spend a little time on that about whatwe saw in Q2, and give you some additional background on the near-termexecution issues that we’re talking about.First, let me be very specific. They are in the non-AI, ACR component. OurAzure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by theoperating teams pulling in some delivery dates, even by weeks. Whenyou’re capacity constrained, weeks matter, and it was good execution bythe team. And you see that in the revenue results.On the non-AI side, really the challenges were in what we call the scalemotions. Think about primarily, these are customers we reach throughpartners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the artform there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are trying tobalance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the workthey’ve done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took our salesmotions in the summer and really changed to try to balance those two.As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners ongetting that balance right, between where to put our investments, where toput the marketing dollars and importantly, where to put people in terms of
coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. And Ithink we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are inbalance, because when you make those changes in the summer, by thetime it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts andwhether you have that balance right.And so the teams are working through that. They’re already makingadjustments, and I expect, while we will see some impact through H2 justbecause when you work through the scale motion, it can take some timefor that to adjust, I feel good that the teams understand and are workingthrough that. Hopefully, that’s just helpful on that.Then, we’ve talked a little bit about Q3. And so, we’ve talked about 31 to 32after publishing a 31 this quarter. Our AI results that we had felt goodabout and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. Again,in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place, and that’sno different than it was our expectation to be in that position last Octoberwhen I talk to you all.And when I talk about being at a capacity constraint, it takes two things.You have to have a space, which I generally call long-lived assets. That’s theinfrastructure and the land. And then you have to have kits. We’recontinuing, and you’ve seen that’s why our spend has pivoted this way tobe in the long-lived investment. We have been short power and space. Andso, as you see, those investments land that we’ve made over the past threeyears, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year.And so, the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms ofbeing able to sell, utilize and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What
we’re seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through thescale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that’s changed is reallythat scale motion from my seat, Keith.Hope that’s helpful. Satya?SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I think, Amy, just one thing I’d add, Keith, to yourquestion is, as Amy said, the AI growth rate is actually better than what weexpected. And we worked through some of the supply stuff and moreimportantly, some of the workloads are scaling well. And when you lookunderneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is theratio of even what we would call just regular storage data services, appservices, so underneath a ChatGPT or a copilot or even these emerging AIworkloads in the enterprise. That’s all good.The enterprise workloads, whether it’s SAP or whether it’s VMwaremigrations, what have you, that’s also in good shape. And it’s just a scaleplace where when Amy talked about this nuance. How do you really tweakthe incentives go to market? At a time of platform shifts, you want to makesure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don’t keep doingthe stuff that you did in the previous generation. And that’s the art formAmy was referencing to make sure you get the right balance, but let me putit this way. You would rather win the new than just protect the past. Andthat’s one of the things that we definitely will lean into, always.BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)
MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much for taking myquestion. Can you give more color on what drove the far larger thanexpected Microsoft AI revenue? We talked a bit about the Azure AIcomponent of it, but can you give more color on that? Our estimates arethat Copilot was much bigger than we had expected and growing muchfaster. Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI beatwould be great. Thanks.AMY HOOD: Thanks, Mark, for the question. Yes, that was, as we talkedabout, better than expected, a couple of pieces to that, which you’vecorrectly identified. Number one is the Azure component we just talkedabout. And the second piece, you’re right, Microsoft Copilot was better.And what was important about that? It was we saw strengths both in seats,both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about, and usage,which doesn’t directly impact revenue, but of course, indirectly does aspeople get more and more value out of it. And also price per seat wasactually quite good, which is another good signal for value.Those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that outperformance in terms of ourexpectations.BRETT IVERSEN: Thank you, Mark. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)
BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Oh, thanks. Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek acouple times in your prepared remarks. I think everyone would love yourthoughts on what you’re seeing there. And are we seeing AI scale now atlower costs? Are we reaching a mark where you can see that or do we stillhave some time to go? Thanks for your thoughts on this.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. Thanks, Brent. In my remarks, I talked about how,in some sense, what’s happening with AI is no different than what washappening with the regular compute cycle. It’s always about bending thecurve and then putting more points up the curve. There’s Moore’s Lawthat’s working and hyperdrive. Then on top of that there is the AI scalinglaws, both the pretraining and the inference time compute that compound,and that’s all software.You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we have observed fora while, which is 10x on improvements per cycle, just because of all thesoftware optimizations on inference. And so, that’s what you see.And then, to that, I think DeepSeek has some real innovations. And that issome of the things that even OpenAI found in o1. And so, we are going to– obviously, now that all gets commoditized, and it’s going to get broadlyused. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is thecustomers, because at the end of the day, if you think about it, what wasthe big lesson learned from client server to cloud? More people boughtservers, except it was called cloud.And so, when token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that meanspeople can consume more. And there will be more apps written. And it’sinteresting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty
powerful, it’s unimaginable to think that here we are in the beginning of‘25, where on the PC, you can run a model that required pretty massivecloud infrastructure. That type of optimizations means AI will be muchmore ubiquitous. And so, therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platformprovider like us, this is all good news as far as I’m concerned.BRENT THILL: Thank you.BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. Maybe this one as well for Satya, andit’s also away from the numbers. But, Satya, I wanted to ask you about theStargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship lastweek. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this asMicrosoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI’s success, butelecting to take more of a back seat in terms of funding OpenAI’s futuretraining CapEx needs.I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate,and Amy, whether there’s any takeaway for investors from that decision interms of how you’re thinking about CapEx needs over the next severalyears. Thank you.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, thanks for the question. We remain very happywith the partnership with OpenAI. And as you saw, they’ve committed in a
big way to Azure. And even in the bookings, what we recognized is just thefirst tranche of it. And so, you’ll see, we’ve given the role for we have morebenefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their success is oursuccess because even all the other commercial arrangements that wedetailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with thatannouncement.But to your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building apretty fungible fleet. We’re making sure that there’s the right balancebetween training and inference. It’s geo-distributed. We are working superhard on all the software optimizations, I mean, just not the softwareoptimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all thework we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models overthe years in partnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work onthe inference optimizations on it, and that’s been key to driving.One of the key things to note in AI is you just don’t launch the frontiermodel, but if it’s too expensive to serve, it’s no good. It won’t generate anydemand. You’ve got to have that optimization so that inferencing costs arecoming down and they can be consumed broadly.And so, that’s the fleet physics we are managing. And also, remember, youdon’t want to buy too much of anything at one time because of theMoore’s Law every year is going to give you 2x. Your optimization is goingto give you 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize thefleet, age the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio ofmodernization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of asthe training expense.
I feel very good about the investment we are making. And it’s fungible, andit just allows us to scale more long-term business.AMY HOOD: And maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments thatI made on CapEx, because I think it’s helpful to ground a bit more in whatSatya is saying a fungible fleet means, we have, and I think we talked aboutit, close to $300 billion of RPO that is committed customer contracts thatneed to be delivered on. And the faster we can do that and the moreefficiently we can do that, the better off we are, not just the OpenAIpartnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that weneed to deliver for our customers.And I think the other thing that sometimes missing is when we say fungible,we mean not just the primary use, which we’ve always talked about, whichis inference, but there is some training, post-training, which is a keycomponent. And then there’s just running the commercial cloud, which atevery layer under every modern AI app that’s going to be built will berequired. It will be required to be distributed, and it’ll be required to beglobal. And all of those things are really important, because it then meansyou’re the most efficient.And so, the investment you see us making CapEx, you’re right. The frontendhas been this infrastructure build that lets us really catch up, not just on theAI infrastructure we needed – think about that as the building itself, datacenters – but also some of the catch up we needed to do on thecommercial cloud side. And then you’ll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU,and that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue. And it’ll be contractedeither with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or withothers.
And so, I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the CapExgrowth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated tocustomer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is.KARL KEIRSTEAD: Thank you.BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)BRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much for taking myquestion, and I’ll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as well.Satya, as we think about Microsoft’s very rich copilot portfolio, now havingbeen in market for over a year, with the products and precision only gettingbetter and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about thejourney from here, and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go tomarket to address the broadest range of customers and customerrequirements out there? Thanks.SATYA NADELLA: Well, thanks, Brad, for the question. In fact, you saw usmake two announcements recently. One is on the M365 Copilot side, wenow have Copilot Chat. This is now going to be broadly deployed acrossthe entire install base, effectively, because you can go have this now turnedon by IT, and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all theenterprise controls right away. And it has Copilot Studio built in.
And so, that means they can start building agents. We think of that plus thefull Copilot as a good combination that I think will accelerate, quite frankly,in terms of just seat usage and agent building, and what have you. That’sone.And the other thing is you also see even on the consumer side, we justyesterday launched o1 or the think harder feature on Copilot now that’spowered by o1, it’s available globally. You can see the benefits of inferenceoptimization, and the cost coming down means you can drive moreubiquity of what features, the ones who were premium tier. And that’s alldefinitely something that we will do across. The same thing is happening inGitHub Copilot, same thing in Security Copilot. Across the length andbreadth of our portfolio, you’ll see that.BRAD ZELNICK: Thank you.BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)BRAD REBACK, Stifel: That’s great. Thank you very much. Satya, if you lookat several years, any sense of what percent of inference done on Azure willbe done on proprietary models versus open models? And with that said,does it matter to Microsoft at the end of the day? Thanks.
SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, it’s a good question because at some level, whatyou’re seeing is effectively lots of models that get used in any application.When you look underneath even a copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what haveyou, you already see lots of many different models. You build models, youfinetune models, you distill models. Some of them are models that youdistill into an open source model. There’s going to be a combination.We’ve always maintained that it’s always good to have frontier models. Youwant to always build your application with high ambition using the bestmodel that is available, and then optimize from there on.That’s also another side. There’s a temporality to it. What you start with as agiven COGS profile doesn’t need to be the end, because you continuouslyoptimize for latency and COGS and putting in different models.And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a newapp server. One of the things that we are investing heavily on is Foundry,because from an app developer perspective, you want to keep pace withthis flurry of models that are coming in. And you want to have an evergreenway for your application to benefit from all that innovation, but not have allthe dev costs or the DevOps cost or what people talk about AI ops costs.We are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload tobe able to benefit from all these different models, open source, closedsource, different weight classes, and at the same time, from an operationsperspective, it’s faster, easier for you.BRAD REBACK: Great, thank you.
BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)BRAD SILLS, Bank of America: Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much. Greatto hear about the strength you’re seeing in Copilot. Would love to getsome color as to where you’re seeing that strength. Is it departmental deals,customers moving from proof of concept to departmental deals, maybemultiple departmental deals in the enterprise?And you mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get somecolor on just the common use cases that you’re seeing that give you thatconfidence that that will ramp into monetization later. Thank you.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I mean, I think the initial set of seats were forplaces where there’s more belief in immediate productivity, a sales team, infinance or in supply chain, where there is a lot of, for example, SharePointgrounded data that you want to be able to use or in conjunction with webdata and have it produce results that are beneficial.But then what’s happening, very much like what we’ve seen in theseprevious generation productivity things, is that people collaborate acrossfunctions, across roles. For example, even my own daily habit is I go to chat,I use work tab and get results, and then I immediately share using Pageswith colleagues. I call it think with AI and work with people. And that
pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard issue across theenterprise.And so, that’s what we’re seeing. It starts maybe at a departmental level.Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that youspread it across. You can do it by cohort and what have you. And so, whatwe’ve made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat plus this. And so, thatgives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have somethingthat’s more ubiquitous.BRAD SILLS: Wonderful. Thank you so much.BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one lastquestion.(Operator Direction.)BRENT BRACELIN, Piper Sandler: Thank you for taking the question here.Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to commercial bookings. CommercialRPO, I think, increased $39 billion sequentially. That’s the most we’ve everseen on a sequential basis. Commercial bookings growth, 75% constantcurrency, that’s 2X higher than we’ve seen in the last decade. I appreciatethere’s some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter,there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog andbookings.
Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength camefrom? Was it broad based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any colorthere would be helpful, thanks.AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. It’s a great question. We talked a little bitabout one of the main drivers, which was one of the Azure commitmentsthat OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, while that is obviously a bigcomponent, you’ll continue to see OpenAI make commitment. I want toseparate the concept that it’s one time versus an ongoing relationship thatwill grow as they grow, which it absolutely will.And to your question on what else is participating in that number, up first,we did have very good core motions. Our core motions are things like, toyour point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-ons to those contracts,upsells, for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes. And Ithink that’s important.We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about suite momentum. And wesaw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about.And then the final component is large Azure commitments, and those reallydid look as we expected, which is good, to your point. And you’re seeing areally broad based growth. Those Azure commitments take two forms. One,it’s existing customers who’ve worked through their commitments and aremaking larger commitments, which is a good commitment sign for theplatform. And then you have new customers making commitments, and wealso saw that this quarter.
And so, to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like thiscan make you think it’s just one thing. I think you’re right. Some of it wasone thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently across theworkloads.BRENT BRACELIN: Thank you.BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’searnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward tospeaking with all of you soon.AMY HOOD: Thank you.SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, all.OPERATOR: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect yourlines at this time. And enjoy the rest of your day.END
