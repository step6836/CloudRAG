Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty toupdate any forward-looking statement.And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.SATYA NADELLA:Thank you, Jonathan.It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us.All up, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%.The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we’veseen.To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI productsand tech stack, at massive scale.And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack, starting withAzure.Azure surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, up 34%, driven by growthacross all workloads.We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave, and took share everyquarter this year.We opened new DCs across six continents, and now have over 400datacenters across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider.
There is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first gigawatt andmulti-gigawatt datacenters.We stood up more than two gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12months alone.And we continue to scale our owned datacenter capacity faster than anyother competitor.Every Azure region is now AI-first.All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibilityand the flexibility of our fleet.And we are driving and riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon,systems, and models to continuously improve the efficiency andperformance for our customers.Take for example GPT4o family of models – which have the highest volumeof inference tokens. Through software optimization alone, we are delivering90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago.Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to addresscustomers’ unique data residency and sovereignty requirements.This quarter we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry’smost comprehensive solution spanning both public and private clouddeployments.
All of this innovation is driving our strong results.We saw accelerating growth from migrations again this quarter.Nestlé, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000-plusservers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near-zero business disruption.That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in businesshistory.The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I am excitedabout our progress.In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operationaldeployment of a Level 2 quantum computer, in partnership with AtomComputing.This is how we will continue to think and make investments with decades-long arcs, while making progress every quarter.The next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application.Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform forthe AI era, spanning everything from SQL to NoSQL to analytics workloads.It continues to gain momentum, with revenue up 55% year-over-year, andover 25,000 customers.It is the fastest growing database product in our history.
Fabric OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including semantic modelsfrom Power BI. And therefore, it is the best source of knowledge andgrounding for AI applications and context engineering.Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well.Cosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission-criticalworkloads at scale.OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every ChatGPTinteraction – storing chat history, user profiles, and conversational state.And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPTas well as OpenAI’s developer APIs.This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design,customize, and manage AI applications and agents, at scale.Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability, andbuilt-in controls for trustworthy AI.Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet theirspecific performance, cost, and use case requirements.And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput once andapply it across more models than any other hyperscaler, including modelsfrom OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI’s Grok, and very soon, Black Forest Labsand Mistral AI.
We sim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year,providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integratedwith our infrastructure and tools.And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry Agent Service,which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents thatautomate complex tasks.For example, Nasdaq is using Foundry to build agents that help customersprepare for board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%.All up, 80% of the Fortune 500 already use Foundry.And when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by FoundryAPIs, we processed over 500 trillion this year, up over 7X.This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head appsand services.Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded inour daily work and life.Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active usersacross commercial and consumer.And when you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features acrossour products, we have over 800 million monthly active users.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming the new way to organize work andworkflow, and work artifacts.We rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to date thisquarter, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks, as well asagents into one intuitive scaffolding.With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeingreal momentum:Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other newMicrosoft 365 suite, with strong usage intensity, as shown by our week-over-week retention.And we saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch with a recordnumber of customers returning to buy more seats.Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000employees globally, following a successful initial deployment of 15,000.UBS is expanding its own deployment to all of its employees, after initiallyrolling it out to 55,000 of them.And Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo all purchased over 25,000 seats thisquarter.Tens of thousands of organizations have already used our Researcher andAnalyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability.
And we have introduced group-level agents in Teams like Facilitator andInterpreter which generate real-time translation and notes in meetings.Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday have builttheir own third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams.We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to extend Microsoft365 Copilot and build their own agents.This year, customers created 3 million agents using SharePoint and CopilotStudio.And with Copilot Tuning, they can easily create agents fine-tuned on theircompany's data, workflows, and style that reflect their unique tone,language, and expertise.We’re also seeing great traction among specific roles and functions, startingwith developers.GitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with AgentMode, and new form factors like Coding agent, which is capable ofasynchronously executing developer tasks.We have 20 million GitHub Copilot users.GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers increased 75% quarter over quarter ascompanies tailor Copilot to their own codebases.And 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot.
More broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growthbecause of AI.AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year.The surge in vibe coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it isClaude Code, Codex, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot are generating more pullrequests and more repos on GitHub.And, our Code Review agent is being used heavily across the platform,performing millions of code reviews each month.In healthcare, we had a breakout year for Dragon Copilot.Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 millionphysician-patient encounters this quarter, up nearly 7X year-over-year.For example, at Mercy health system more than 1,000 physicians arealready using Copilot to reduce administrative burden so they can focus onproviding better care.They have saved more than 100,000 hours to date and plan to expand to all5,000 providers.As one physician put it: “The best thing to happen to my practice in 10years.”And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to helpdefenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks.
More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the biz apps market, ascustomers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications.Dynamics 365 took share this year.And we are winning customers in every industry, like Verizon with Sales,Domino’s Pizza Group with ERP, and 1-800-Flowers with Contact Center.When it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces.In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot Mode in Edge.It’s especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers!Copilot Mode brings together the Copilot composer, chat, discover, search,and actions to build the next generation browser for the AI age.Our Copilot consumer app also continues to see strong growth inengagement and successful sessions.And we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC.With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real-time insights and assistance on anything.And we are well positioned as we approach Windows 10 end-of-support inOctober, thanks to both Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs, which offercustomers compelling security as well as AI value.Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure, as wellas our Copilots and agents.
We have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year.Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIEM MicrosoftSentinel, bringing together customer data across our first-party tools and athird-party ecosystem of over 350 connectors.We are also extending the systems customers already use for governance,identity, security, and management, to protect every AI agent.Entra now extends identity permissions, policies, and access controls toagents.Defender secures nearly 2 million GenAI apps.Purview is used by three quarters of Microsoft 365 Copilot customers toprotect their data.And, all up, we now have nearly 1.5 million security customers and continueto take share across all major categories we serve.Before I wrap, I want to talk about two consumer businesses of ours withmassive end user reach: LinkedIn and Xbox.LinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members, with four consecutive years ofdouble-digit member growth.All up, comments on LinkedIn rose over 30% and video uploads increasedover 20% this year.
We continue to bring AI to every part of the LinkedIn experience,introducing agents across hiring as well as sales.When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users acrossplatforms and devices.And we are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation thisquarter, with the successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and OblivionRemastered.The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger: 50 million people haveplayed Black Ops 6. Total hours surpassed 2 billion.Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanksin large part to the success of the Minecraft movie.And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more tocome.We surpassed over 500 million hours of game play streamed via the cloudthis year.And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI.And I have never been more confident in Microsoft’s opportunity to drivelong-term growth and define what the future looks like.
With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results,as well as the outlook.AMY HOOD:Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This year, we deliveredover $281 billion in revenue, up 15% year-over-year which reflects thebroad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over$128 billion, up 17% year-over-year as we invested against the expansiveopportunity ahead.And in our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceededexpectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. AsSatya shared, we’re innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to ourcustomers.This quarter, revenue was $76.4 billion, up 18% and 17% in constantcurrency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currencywhile operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. Andearnings per share was $3.65, an increase of 24% and 22% in constantcurrency.For the first time, commercial bookings were over $100 billion, increasing37% and 30% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable.Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy
renewals, as well as an increase in the number of 10-million and 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 helped drivethese results.Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368 billion, up37% and 35% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized inrevenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remainingportion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 49%. And thisquarter, our annuity mix was again 98%.FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue,segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew27% and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross marginpercentage was slightly better than expected at 68% down 2 points year-over-year from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset bycontinued efficiency gains in Azure and M365 commercial cloud.Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down 1 point year-over-yeardriven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Microsoft Cloud grossmargin noted earlier.Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency andoperating margins increased 2 points year-over-year to 45%. Better-than-expected revenue growth coupled with a focus on operating efficientlydrove the margin expansion.
At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was relativelyunchanged year-over-year.Now to our segment results.Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33.1 billion andgrew 16% and 14% in constant currency, better than expected, driven byM365 commercial products and cloud services and M365 consumerproducts and cloud services.M365 commercial cloud revenue was ahead of expectations and increased18% and 16% in constant currency with two points of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Business trends remained relatively stable tothe prior quarter when excluding the in-period revenue recognition, withARPU growth again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercialseats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across allcustomer segments, though primarily in our small and medium businessand frontline worker offerings.M365 commercial products revenue increased 9% and 7% in constantcurrency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024transactional purchasing.M365 consumer cloud revenue was better than expected increasing 20%driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscribergrowth of 8%.
LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency with growthacross all businesses, though Talent Solutions continues to be impacted byweakness in the hiring market.Dynamics 365 revenue increased 23% and 21% in constant currency, withstrong execution in our core annuity sales motions leading to growthacross all workloads.Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currencyand gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by the efficiencygains noted earlier, even as we deliver more AI features across our productsand scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 7% and 6% inconstant currency and operating income increased 21% and 19% inconstant currency.Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $29.9 billion and grew26% and 25% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by Azureand our on-premises server business.In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39%, significantly ahead ofexpectations driven by accelerated growth in our core infrastructurebusiness primarily from our largest customers. As a reminder, new cloudand AI workloads are built and scaled using the breadth of our services.Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with expectations.And, while we brought additional datacenter capacity online this quarter,demand remains higher than supply.
In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and 3% inconstant currency, ahead of expectations primarily driven by transactionalpurchasing which also has higher in-period revenue recognition.Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 7% and 6% in constantcurrency with growth in Enterprise Support Services partially offset by adecline in Industry Solutions.Segment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 16% in constant currencyand gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year-over-year driven byscaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains notedearlier. Operating expenses increased 6% and 4% in constant currency andoperating income grew 23%.Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.5 billion and grew 9%,exceeding expectations primarily due to Windows OEM as well as Xboxcontent and services.Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year, ahead ofexpectations, as inventory levels remained elevated.Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% inconstant currency driven by continued growth in both volume and revenueper search, as well as roughly 8 points of favorable impact from third-partypartnerships, including the benefit of a low prior year comparable.
And in Gaming, revenue increased 10%. Xbox content and services revenueincreased 13% and 12% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass.Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%. Gross margin percentageincreased 3 points year-over-year with improvement across all businesses.Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency. Operatingincome increased 34% and 33% in constant currency driven by continuedprioritization of higher margin opportunities.Now, back to total company results.Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of financeleases where we recognize the full value at the time of leasecommencement. Cash paid for P, P, and E, was $17.1 billion. The differenceis primarily due to finance leases. More than half of our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years andbeyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs andGPUs, and driven by strong demand signals.Cash flow from operations was $42.6 billion, up 15% driven by strong cloudbillings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. Andthis quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion.Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion, primarily due to losseson investments accounted for under the equity method.
Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%.And finally, we returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends andshare repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over$37 billion for the full fiscal year.Now, moving to our outlook.My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a US dollarbasis unless specifically noted otherwise.Let me start with some full year commentary for FY26.First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase fullyear revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately 2 points and toincrease operating expense growth by one point.Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expectto deliver another year of double-digit revenue and operating incomegrowth in FY26. We will continue to invest against the expansiveopportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operatingexpenses given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strongdemand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contractedbacklog. Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, willmoderate compared to FY25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due tothe timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance
lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. Weremain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing ouroperational agility, and as a result, expect operating margins to be relativelyunchanged year-over-year.And finally, we expect our FY26 effective tax rate to be between 19% and20%.Now to our outlook for the first quarter.Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth byroughly 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes, and roughly 1point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX toincrease COGS and operating expense growth by roughly one point.In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a growing expirybase. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across ourcore annuity sales motions and long-term commitments to our platform. Asa reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictablein their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growthrate.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, downyear-over-year driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AIinfrastructure.
We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion driven by thecontinued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can bequarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and thetiming of delivery of finance leases.Next to segment guidance.In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $32.2 to $32.5billion, or growth of 14% to 15% with roughly 3 points of benefit from FX asnoted earlier.In M365 commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13%and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relativelystable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven byE5 and M365 Copilot.M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid to high-single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes both theWindows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Officetransactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in periodrevenue recognition dynamics.M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the low twenties drivenby the January price increase.For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits.
And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teenswith continued growth across all workloads.For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue of $30.1 to $30.4 billion, or growthof 25% to 26% with roughly 1 point of benefit from FX as noted earlier.Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterlyvariability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacitydelivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenuerecognition depending on the mix of contracts.In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constantcurrency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on asignificant base. Even as we continue bringing more datacenter capacityonline, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the firsthalf of our fiscal year.In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the lowto mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings.In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 to $12.9billion.Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid to highsingle digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 tocome down thru the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of
potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue shoulddecline.Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low-to mid-teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following thebenefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue tobe driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. OverallSearch and news advertising revenue growth should be in the low doubledigits.And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high singledigits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content andservices revenue to decline in the mid single digits.Now back to company guidance.We expect COGS of $24.3 to $24.5 billion or growth of 21% to 22% andoperating expense of $15.7 to $15.8 billion or growth of 5% to 6%.Other income and expense is estimated to be negative $1.3 billion primarilydue to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder,we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity methodinvestments.And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.In closing, we finished the year with double digit revenue and operatingincome growth and exceeded the FY25 operating margin commitment we
shared a year ago. Our focus remains on investing in security, quality, andAI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity toour customers. We are excited for FY26.With that, let’s go to Q&A, Jonathan.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out ofrespect on the call, we request the participants please only ask onequestion. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?(Operator Direction.)KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Thank you, guys, for taking the question,and congratulations on a fantastic end to FY25. I’ve been coveringMicrosoft for a while. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a quarter of whereeverything came together this well. Congratulations on that execution.Maybe a little bit longer-term focused question to start out: You guys havealways had software startups as customers and potentially emergingcompetitors, but the AI labs now feel different. Investors are ascribingvaluations, which assume these companies become major players insoftware. They’re underwriting revenue forecast measured in the tens ofbillions, if not hundreds of billions. And these startups have also grown tobe some of your biggest customers, so they’re contributing significantly toMicrosoft today.
It seems like there’s a lot of potential opportunity in supporting thosebusinesses, but also it’s not certain that they’re going to stay yourcustomers as they scale. They could insource some of that infrastructure,and they very likely emerge as potential competitors.As managers of Microsoft, as managers of the capital, how do you guysmanage that risk versus reward with the quickly emerging AI labs in theseAI startups?SATYA NADELLA: Thanks, Keith, for the question. I don’t think it’s thatdifferent from even the previous era. There’s always been, I’ll call it, headapps or new companies that emerge that, in fact, are very needed in orderto birth a new platform. Back in the day, when I was getting started onAzure, I used to look over the lake and see Netflix and Amazon. And I’d say,I wish Netflix ran on Azure. And in some sense, that’s kind of what we nowhave, which is the largest AI workloads run on Azure.And when that happens, you learn the workload faster. You optimize theentire platform faster, everything from what we’re doing with Cosmos DBfor a chat interface like ChatGPT or Copilot, is, guess what, going to bemost relevant for any AI application, going forward. The entire data stackthat we have now built is going to be optimized for what people describeas one of the hardest challenges of any AI application, called contextengineering, which is, how do you collect your data and then make sure
that the context around the prompts remain stable over a long period, sothat you get the intelligence to actually deliver the results you want.These are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build boththe products as well as the platform, and then, broadly, or rather, over time,there will be broad diffusion. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I trackis not just the head app usage, but also what’s all the Tier 2 applicationsthat are being built.That speaks a little bit, Keith, to, I think, your question, is as long as we havehead apps shaping the platform, and then after that, we have the broaddiffusion happen, which, in some sense, both of those is what we’re seeing.I feel very good about being in good standing, going forward.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Keith. Operator, the next question, please.(Operator Direction.)MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you. I also give you mycongratulations. Amazing. I didn’t know how you were going to beat lastquarter, and you did it. Congratulations, and thank you for taking myquestion.Satya and Amy, we’re now two-plus years since the gen AI revolution, andadoption is still early and ramping. What do you think is the best way thatsoftware companies are going to be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do youbelieve there are differences in monetization for horizontal, more general
apps like M365 Copilot or Dynamics CRM Copilot, versus very targetedcapacities on the agentic side? And also, how should you think about thetrajectory of SaaS AI margins over the long term? Thank you.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I’ll start, and Amy, you should feel free to add. Imean, if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I think, just likethe server to cloud transition was an expansion of essentially, usage ofservers, that is essentially what happened with the cloud, which is we did abunch of servers, except that the expertise required, the capital required,the time required to bring up servers, build it out scale, it was just all hard.And so, therefore, the market was a certain size. Whereas with the cloud,you could buy it with flexibility, you could burst and you could spin up andspin down. The expertise required came down. It was just orders ofmagnitude. That’s what’s happening. If you even subscribe to this point ofview that intelligence is basically log of compute, that means compute isgoing to grow, and you’ve got to use it as efficiently as possible to justkeep creating intelligence.Now, how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure? To Keith’s earlierquestion, I talked a little bit about how infrastructure is getting shaped,data layer is getting shaped. The app server is getting built. These are allclassic categories of infrastructure that will continue, but they will be anorder or two of magnitude more. Literally, in fact, one of the other things
we track is every GPU requires storage and compute. That ratio is anotherthing that is really exponential for infrastructure growth.When you go to the app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now buildingin effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence. And they’re alsobuilding autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications, like adatabase application, perhaps, but they are being used increasingly inapplications, inside of a user interaction.I think a good example is GitHub Copilot. It got started as codecompletions on an IDE. Then we added the chat interface to it. Then weadded the agent mode to it. And now we have an autonomous agent,which, in fact, works completely asynchronously. All those four things arenow part of, essentially GitHub.And by the way, it also turns out that every other tool that is also doing anyform of coding is adding more and more GitHub repos. If I had to thinkabout GitHub monetization, we have an opportunity around justmonetizing GitHub Enterprise. And then we have the ability to think aboutGitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot, as with all these form factors.And so, that’s exactly the same thing that’s happening with Microsoft 365.That’s the same thing that’s happening with Dynamics 365. You have to bevery open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier and your UI tierand being more expansive in it. As long as you do that, it’s just that usagegoes up. And that’s what I think shows up in the results.
AMY HOOD: And I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the thingsin the layer Satya talked about, is really, we’re seeing very similarmonetization tools exist in this transition, too. There’s a per-user logic.There’s tiers of per user. Sometimes those tiers relate to consumption.Sometimes there’s pure consumption models.I think you’ll continue to see a blending of these, especially as the AI modelcapability grows. You’ll end up with ways that teams are going to want tothrottle that usage, use the best models for the best job. And I think theblending of these models will continue to be something we see on the go-forward basis.MARK MOERDLER: Thank you. I appreciate it.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, thanks. Satya and Amy, this is the secondquarter in a row of pretty material Azure upside from what sounds like anacceleration in on-prem to Azure migration activity. I’m just wondering ifyou can comment on the plethora of customer conversations you’ve had,whether there are a couple of two or three specific catalysts that are drivingthat migration, and how durable a trend do you think that is? Thank you.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I mean, just that three things are really happening.One is the migrations. A good example would be what I referenced in my
remarks with Nestle, with the SAP instances they moved, along with a lot ofthe data that’s associated with it in a bunch of servers. That’s a classicexample, I think, whether it’s VMware migrations or migrations of SAP oreven just our own server migrations, they’re pretty healthy. And it turns outthat we’re still not anywhere close to the finish line, at best, maybe in themiddle innings of that.The second thing that’s also happening is cloud-native applications that arescaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff, just the classic cloud-nativee-commerce company, let’s say. These are scaling in a big way. And someof those customers were not on Azure previously, but now, they’reincreasingly there because they have come for AI, perhaps, but they nowstay for more than AI.And so, to me, that’s another thing you see in overall, what’s happeningacross the Azure number. And then, of course, there are the new AIworkloads.Those are three things that are all, in some sense, building on each other,but that’s kind of what’s driving our growth.KARL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. Thank you.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)
BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Satya, back to the strength across the board in thequarter, was there anything that jumped out you or surprised you that youdidn’t think you were going to see, but you did see in the quarter? Just themagnitude of upside, I think, had shocked many here.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I don’t know, Brent, if anything really surprised us,but I think what we are noticing in our own buildout of these AIapplications, and in general, is the platform’s becoming more than here is amodel and here’s an API, make some calls. I mean that, in some sense, wasa bit of the state of the art, maybe even a year ago, whereas now you haveessentially, these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that requirequite a bit of rethinking of even the app stack.I mean, take even the storage tier stuff, the degree of sophistication youhave. And hey, how much of an index do you really want to build bypreprocessing, so that your prompt engineering, or context engineering, asI call it, can be better and higher quality. I think all of that is emerging.When I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric and Cosmos DB, all ofthe things, the frameworks around it are just becoming robust to buildserious applications. And so, that’s what I feel great about, is the learningcurve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of the stack,the speed with which that’s emerging that you can build applications ismuch faster.
I always go back and say, hey, when our relational database came out, ittook a while for people to build an ERP system, let’s say. And this thing,we’re building pretty sophisticated applications at a very, very fast clip,based on, I think, the degree of maturity that’s emerging.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me aswell. I had one question around Copilot, and I’m obviously a happy, happyuser here at Barclays.If you think about it, the one thing that we’re all realizing is that Copilot isthe AI part, but data is becoming more and more important. And then fromthere on, we can start thinking about agents. What are you seeing in yourcustomer conversation, Satya, about that understanding that Copilot isactually just the starting point, and then from there on, it’s becoming likemuch, much broader? Thank you.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I think that that’s right. Even inside of Copilot, I’msure you’re seeing it. You now have Analyst and Researcher, to just talkabout two examples, and of course, all the third-party agents. Yeah, there isa lot more of just not request response. It’s about spawning, essentially,applications that then go to work and come back.
But the UI still remains very important, even for asynchronous work. Toinstruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronouswork, you need UI. It may be different. It may not be a chat interface, and ofcourse, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is.Even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you’re not usingGitHub Copilot to create the code check in or the pull request, interestinglyenough, we’re seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot Code ReviewAgent, even if you used maybe Claude code or whatever else to write thecode. That’s, I think, what’s happening across all of these systems.You’re right that you need to start with some kind of a UI that’s more chatfocused, but it quickly goes beyond it. And you see it in M365, you see it inDynamics 365, and you see it in GitHub.RAIMO LENSCHOW: Thank you.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Raimo. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Hi. Thank you very much. Amy, I want toacknowledge that I think a few quarters ago you said that you reach a pointin time where you can accelerate Azure while slowing down capex. You didit, but what is the outlook? When I look at the capex guidance for theupcoming quarter, certainly, I would view that as a positive indicator of thebook of business you have for your cloud services.
But how should we think about the shape of the curve of capex vis a visAzure growth rate in the years ahead, particularly as you listen to Satyacomments on the AI stack consuming more and more infrastructure. Are weat a point where we’re going to have to continue to do this, and wemagically wait for inference and applications to kick in and therefore, createa richer gross margin mix?Thank you so much for your comments, and congrats on the quarter.AMY HOOD: Thanks, Kash. Let me back up and first say, when you thinkabout the full year comments I’ve made on capex, as well as the Q1guidance of over $30 billion, you first have to ground yourself in the factthat we have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not justacross Azure, but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud.In terms of feeling good about the ROI and the growth rates and thecorrelation, I feel very good that the spend that we’re making is correlatedto basically contracted on the books business that we need to deliver, andwe need the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in placeas quickly and effectively as they can.And so, when you look, as we’ve talked about, the growth rate will declineyear over year, but at its core, our investments, particularly in short-livedassets like servers, GPUs, CPUs, network and storage, is just really correlatedto the backlog we see and the curve of demand. And I talked about it, mygosh, in January, and said I thought we’d be in better supply demand shape
by June. And now, I’m saying I hope I’m in better shape by December. Andthat’s not because we slowed capex. Even with accelerating the spend andtrying to pull leases in and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly aswe can, we are still seeing demand improve.And so, I am not as focused, Kash, on trying to pick a date at which revenuegrowth and capex growth will meet and cross. I’m focused on buildingbacklog, building business and delivering capacity, which we are seeing hasa good ROI today in terms of our ability to get that done. I don’t wantpeople to get overly focused on a pivot point, because when you’re inthese expansive moments, picking a data point usually means you’re goingto pick to be too conservative in terms of market share gain and in terms ofwinning. And so, I tend to put my energy more there.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I think one of the other things, Kash, is that I thinkI said this in a previous learnings as well, which is the difference between ahoster and a hyperscaler is software, and the same is going to be true here.That GPT-4o example I gave is all software, the optimization even in the lastyear.We know how to use the software skills to take any piece of hardware andmake it multiple x better. And so, that’s where the yield will come, but asAmy said, while you’re really going and building out the plant, you don’twant to serialize it. You just want to go in parallel on all of these fronts, andthat’s what will compound over time.
AMY HOOD: And I do think it’s important, when Satya talks about thesoftware layer, he’s talking about, in his comments, to connect us back tothe compounding S-curves. And so, I would remind people that issomething that we saw through the prior cloud transition. It’s how weoperated through that one, and the same skills and logic done at an evenfaster pace is what will apply to the same transition.KASH RANGAN: Sounds very encouraging. Thank you so much.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)MICHAEL TURRIN, Wells Fargo: Hey, great. Thanks very much for takingthe questions, and congrats from me as well on the metrics working inconcert here.Amy, maybe on margin, impressive to hear expectations for flat operatingmargin the upcoming year, as you absorb some of the mix shift towardsAzure and some of the more AI-focused offerings. Can you speak in moredetail just around your ability to manage those tradeoffs and offset some ofthe mix shift? And I’m wondering specifically, just on any productivity gainsyou’re seeing from leveraging AI internally that you’d highlight, or anythingelse you just mentioned, and underpinning the full year expectation there.Thank you.
AMY HOOD: Thanks, Michael. I think really, the area to focus on is whenyou think about margin. I think sometimes people get a lot of energyaround cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus onmaking sure you deliver great product that’s competitive and innovativeand can take share, because that drives revenue. And revenue itself andrevenue growth, as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durableway to see margin improvement. It builds on itself.That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked toKash a little bit about before – Satya and I both mentioned it – is applyingall of our skillset here to deliver efficiencies, whether that’s at whateverlayer of the stack that exists. The S-curves compound, and we are doingthat work. And we’re focused on it at the same time we’re doing the buildout. You’ll see improvements there, even as we continue to invest.And then, of course, it’s about continuing to have great talent here focuson products and opportunities where we have the biggest markets and themost likelihood of success. And so, when we have those three thingshappen, and the energy is right and the focus is there, it gives meconfidence in terms of margin delivery. But make no mistake, it starts andends really with product, which is what we’re really focused on here, anddelivering that to customers.MICHAEL TURRIN: That all sounds pretty good. Thanks very much.
JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Michael. That wraps up the Q&A portion oftoday’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forwardto speaking with you all soon.SATYA NADELLA: Thank you.AMY HOOD: Thank you.(Operator Direction.)END
