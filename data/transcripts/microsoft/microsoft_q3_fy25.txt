our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty toupdate any forward-looking statement.And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.SATYA NADELLA:Thank you, Jonathan.It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud,which surpassed $42 billion in revenue, up 22% in constant currency.Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output,reduce costs, and accelerate growth.Now, I will highlight examples, starting with infrastructure.We continue to expand our datacenter capacity. This quarter alone, weopened DCs in 10 countries across four continents.Model capabilities are doubling in performance every six months, thanks tomultiple, compounding scaling laws.We continue to optimize and drive efficiencies across every layer – from DCdesign, to hardware and silicon, to systems software, to model optimization– all towards lowering costs and increasing performance.You see this in our supply chain, where we have reduced dock-to-leadtimes for new GPUs by nearly 20%.
Across our blended fleet, where we have increased AI performance bynearly 30% ISO power.And, our cost per token, which has more than halved.When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand, withcustomers in every industry, from Abercrombie & Fitch Co., to Coca-Colaand ServiceNow, expanding their footprints on Azure.And we remain the cloud of choice for customers’ mission critical VMWare,SAP, and Oracle workloads, with more regional availability than any otherhyperscaler.We are also excited about the next frontier in cloud systems with quantum.In addition to putting our quantum stack on machines from our partners,we are also making real progress on a path to a utility scale quantumcomputer with the introduction of Majorana-1.When it comes to data and analytics, we have deeply integrated our AIplatform with our data stack.PostgreSQL usage accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, and it isnow used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 including companies like BMWand BNY Mellon.Cosmos DB revenue growth also accelerated again this quarter and remainsthe go-to database for globally distributed NoSQL workloads at any scale. It
is used by customers in every industry like CarMax, DocuSign, NTT Data,and OpenAI.This quarter, we also saw analytics consumption accelerate.Microsoft Fabric has more than 21,000 paid customers, up 80% year-over-year.Fabric brings together data workloads like data warehousing, data science,real-time intelligence, along with Power BI, into one end to end solution.Real-time intelligence is now the fastest growing workload in Fabric, with40% of customers already using it just five months since becominggenerally available.All up, more than 50% of Fabric customers – like Amore Pacific, Louisianastate government, and Petrobras – use three or more workloads.And the amount of data in our multi-cloud data lake OneLake has grownmore than 6X over the past year.Now, on to AI platforms and tools.Foundry is the agent and AI app factory.It is now used by developers at over 70,000 enterprises and digital natives –from Atomicwork, to Epic, Fujitsu, and Gainsight, to H&R Block and LGElectronics – to design, customize, and manage their AI apps and agents.
We processed over 100 trillion tokens this quarter, up 5X year-over-year –including a record 50 trillion tokens last month alone.And four months in, over 10,000 organizations have used our new AgentService to build, deploy, and scale their agents.This quarter we also made a new suite of fine-tuning tools available tocustomers with industry-leading reliability.And we brought the latest models from OpenAI, along with new modelsfrom Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, Stability to Foundry.And we have expanded our Phi family of SLMs with new multimodal andmini models. All up, Phi has been downloaded 38 million times.And our research teams are taking it one step further, with BitNet b1.58, abillion parameter large language model that can run on just CPUs, comingto the Foundry.Now, on to developer tools.We are evolving GitHub Copilot from pair to peer programmer.With agent mode in VS Code, Copilot can now iterate on code, recognizeerrors, and fix them automatically.This adds to other Copilot agents like Autofix, which helps developersremediate vulnerabilities, as well as Code Review Agent, which has alreadyreviewed over 8 million pull requests.
And we are previewing a first-of-its-kind SWE agent capable ofasynchronously executing developer tasks.All-up, we now have over 15 million GitHub Copilot users, up over 4X year-over-year.And both digital natives like Twilio and enterprises like Cisco, HPE,SkyScanner, and Target, continue to choose GitHub Copilot to equip theirdevelopers with AI throughout the entire dev lifecycle.With Visual Studio and VS Code, we have the world’s most popular editor,with over 50 million monthly active users.And with Power Platform we have the leading low code platform for AImakers too.We now have 56 million monthly active Power Platform users, up 27% year-over-year, who increasingly use our AI features to build apps and automateprocesses.Now, on to the future of work.Microsoft 365 Copilot is built to facilitate human-agent collaboration.Hundreds of thousands of customers across geographies and industriesnow use Copilot, up 3X year-over-year.Our overall deal size continues to grow, and this quarter, we saw a recordnumber of customers returning to buy more seats.
And we are going further.Just last week, we announced a major update, bringing together agents,notebooks, search, and create into a new scaffolding for work.Our new Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents analyze vastamounts of web and enterprise data to deliver highly-skilled expertise ondemand directly within Copilot.Beyond horizontal knowledge work, we are introducing agents for everyrole and business process.Our Sales Agent turns contacts into qualified leads, and with Sales Chatreps can quickly get up to speed on new accounts.And our Customer Service Agent is deflecting customer inquiries andhelping service reps resolve issues faster.With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot and build their ownagents with no-code/low code.More than 230,000 organizations – including 90% of the Fortune 500 – havealready used Copilot Studio.With deep reasoning and agent flows in Copilot Studio, customers canbuild agents that perform more complex tasks, and also handledeterministic scenarios like document processing and financial approvals.
And they can now build “computer use” agents that take action on the UIacross desktop and web apps.And, with just a click, they can turn any SharePoint site into an agent too.This quarter alone, customers created over 1 million custom agents acrossSharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130% quarter-over-quarter.When it comes to business applications, Dynamics 365 again took share ascompanies like Avaya, Brunswick, SoftCat, switched to Dynamics fromlegacy providers.Verizon, for example, chose Dynamics 365 Sales to improve the efficiency ofits sellers.In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is off to a fast start.Last quarter alone, we helped document nearly 9.5 million physician-patientencounters at providers like City of Hope, Ottawa Hospital, Tufts Medicineand WellStar, up over 50% quarter-over-quarter.In manufacturing, we introduced Factory Operations and Safety Agents atHannover Messe. And leading partners like Autodesk, PTC, and Siemenshave all built their own industrial AI solutions on our stack.And, in retail, we have introduced agents to help customers like Bath &Body Works build more personalized shopping experiences and improvestore operations.
When it comes to Windows, Copilot+ PCs are faster and have better batterylife than other devices in their category.We also continue to win new customers with best-in-class AI capabilities.We offer a growing number of AI apps from partners like Adobe, Canva,and Zoom.Just last week, we rolled out exclusive AI experiences like Recall, Click to Do,and Windows Search, to all Copilot+ PCs.And we continue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end-of-support for Windows 10.Windows 11 commercial deployments increased nearly 75% year-over-year.Now, on to security.Security is our top priority, and we have made significant progress againstthe engineering objectives we outlined a year and a half ago as part of ourSecure Future Initiative.We are now applying these learnings to deliver new innovation across ourplatform.Last month, along with our partners, we introduced Security Copilot agentsto help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks,informed by 84 trillion daily threat signals.
We also added new capabilities to Defender, Entra, and Purview to helporganizations secure and govern their AI deployments.All up, we now have 1.4 million security customers. Over 900,000 –including EY Global, Manpower Group, TriNet, Regions Bank – have 4 ormore workloads, up 21% year-over-year.And, in identity, Entra now has more than 900 million monthly active users.Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn.Over one billion professionals use LinkedIn to connect, learn, hire, and sell –and our membership continues to grow at double digits year-over-year.Time spent watching videos on the platform was up 36%, and commentswere up 32% year-over-year.We are also seeing more members use AI to gain new skills and find jobs.The number of learners who have used AI-powered coaching increasedover 2X quarter-over-quarter.And we remain the market leader in hiring, as customers like Equinix andVerizon use LinkedIn Hiring Assistant to find qualified candidates faster.When it comes to LinkedIn Premium, we saw over 75% quarter-over-quarter subscriber growth to our Premium Pages offering for SMBs.
And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be the best way to reachB2B decision makers, with two consecutive quarters of accelerated revenuegrowth.More broadly, when it comes to advertising, we are transforming howpeople search, browse, discover content, and use AI as a personal assistant.With Copilot Search in Bing, we are reimagining search results withoverview pages curated by AI, and embedded conversational capabilities.With Copilot Vision in Edge, Copilot sees what you see and gives you real-time responses while you browse.With Copilot Discover, we are personalizing the MSN experience, based onuser interactions and preferences.And with our updated Copilot app, we are focused on building dailyengagement and successful sessions across a range of modalities, whetherit is conversing, searching, shopping, or travel planning.All up, we again took share across Bing and Edge.And our total advertising revenue across our businesses has surpassed $20billion over the last 12 months.Now, on to gaming.We continue to transform the business and focus on margin expansion, aswe bring our games to over 500 million monthly active users across devices.
We ended the quarter as the top publisher by pre-orders and pre-installson both Xbox and the PlayStation Store.PC Game Pass revenue increased over 45% year-over-year.With Xbox Play Anywhere, players now can access more than 1,000 gamesthey can play across console and PC.And just last week we brought cloud gaming to LG TVs.Cloud gaming set a new record, surpassing 150 million hours played for thefirst time this quarter.We are also integrating AI across Xbox.New Copilot for Gaming is a personalized gaming companion that providesin-game assistance and expert coaching. And our first of its kind Musemodel can generate gameplay in real-time.Finally, it is fantastic to see the success of Minecraft Movie which is the topgrossing film of the year.In addition to monetizing our IP in new ways, we have seen a 75 percent-plus increase in weekly active users of the game year-over-year since therelease.In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across bothconsumer and commercial businesses.
In just a few weeks, at our Build conference, we will share how we’recreating the most powerful AI platform for developers—and I encourageyou to tune in.With that, let me turn it over to Amy.AMY HOOD:Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was$70.1 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollarsincreased 11% and 13% in constant currency while operating incomeincreased 16% and 19% in constant currency. And earnings per share was$3.46, an increase of 18% and 19% in constant currency.Results exceeded expectations driven by focused execution from our salesand partner teams. We continue to see strong demand for our cloud and AIofferings as they help customers drive productivity, increase efficiencies,and grow their businesses. And, again this quarter, revenue from our AIbusiness was above expectations.Commercial bookings increased 18% and 17% in constant currency,significantly ahead of expectations again this quarter, driven by an Azurecommitment from OpenAI. We also saw consistent execution across ourcore annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to ourplatform.
Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $315 billion, up34% and 33% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized inrevenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year over year. The remainingportion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 47%. And thisquarter, our annuity mix was 98%.FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue,segment level revenue, and operating expense growth. FX decreased COGSgrowth by only 1 point, 1 point unfavorable to expectations.Microsoft Cloud revenue was $42.4 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew20% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross marginpercentage was 69%, in line with expectations, and decreased 3 points yearover year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.Company gross margin percentage was also 69%, down 1 point year overyear driven by scaling our AI infrastructure.Operating expenses increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, lower thanexpected due to our focus on cost efficiencies as well as investments thatshifted to Q4. Operating margins increased 1 point year over year to 46%,better than expected as we continue to focus on building high-performingteams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers.At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 2% higherthan a year ago and was down slightly compared to last quarter.
Now to our segment results.Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.9 billion andgrew 10% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven byLinkedIn, Microsoft 365 commercial products, and Microsoft 365 consumer.M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 12% and 15% in constantcurrency, in line with expectations. ARPU growth was again driven by E5and M365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth acrosscustomer segments and geos. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% yearover year to over 430 million. While we continue to see installed baseexpansion across all customer segments, growth was primarily driven byour small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.M365 commercial products revenue increased 5% and 8% in constantcurrency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Officetransactional purchasing.M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 10% and 12% in constantcurrency, ahead of expectations driven by higher-than-expectedsubscription growth following the January price increase. M365 consumersubscriptions grew 9% to 87.7 million.LinkedIn revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Results wereahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance across allbusinesses. The Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted byweakness in the hiring market.
Dynamics 365 revenue increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, in linewith expectations with continued growth across all workloads.Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currencyand gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year evenwith the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expensesincreased 1% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased15% and 18% in constant currency.Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.8 billion and grew21% and 22% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by Azure.In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 33% and 35% in constantcurrency including 16 points from AI services. Focused execution drovenon-AI services results where we saw accelerated growth in our enterprisecustomer segment as well as some improvement in our scale motions. And,in Azure AI services, we brought capacity online faster than expected.In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 6% and 4% inconstant currency, slightly below expectations driven by renewals withlower in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. The yearover year decline is reflective of the continued customer shift to cloudofferings.Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constantcurrency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expectedperformance in Enterprise Support Services.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currencyand gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year over year driven byscaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and 7% inconstant currency and operating income grew 17% and 18% in constantcurrency.Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.4 billion and grew 6%and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected results across all businesses.Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year over year, ahead ofexpectations as tariff uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventorylevels that remained elevated.Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 23% inconstant currency. Results were significantly ahead of expectations drivenby usage from a third-party partnership, better-than-expected rateexpansion, and volume growth across Edge and Bing.And in Gaming, revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Xboxcontent and services revenue increased 8% and 9% in constant currency,ahead of expectations driven by stronger-than-expected performance inthird-party and first-party content.Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 11% in constant currency.Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year over year driven by strongexecution on margin improvement in Search and Gaming.
Operating expenses increased 1%. Operating income increased 21% and23% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of highermargin opportunities.Now back to total company results.Capital expenditures including finance leases were $21.4 billion, slightlylower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery ofdata center leases. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $16.7 billion. Roughly halfof our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will supportmonetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud andAI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customersbased on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog of$315 billion.Cash flow from operations was $37 billion, up 16% driven by strong cloudbillings and collections, partially offset by higher tax payments. And thisquarter, free cash flow was $20.3 billion.Other income and expense was negative $623 million, more favorable thananticipated primarily due to net gains on derivatives and investments. Ourlosses on investments accounted for under the equity method were slightlyhigher than expected.Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.
And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends andshare repurchases, an increase of 15% year over year.Now, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise,is on a US dollar basis.First, thru April, demand signals across our commercial businesses as wellas in LinkedIn, Gaming, and Search have remained consistent. Our outlookassumes those trends continue in Q4. If the environment changes, ourresults may be impacted. In our Windows OEM business, our outlookassumes the elevated inventory levels from Q3 will come down in Q4. Wehave widened our guidance range in our More Personal Computingsegment to account for some of this variability.Next, FX. With the weakening of the US dollar in April, we now expect FX toincrease total revenue growth by one point. Within the segments, weexpect FX to increase revenue growth by one point in Productivity andBusiness Processes and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud and MorePersonal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operatingexpense growth by less than one point.In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a significant prior yearcomparable and a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will be driven bystrong execution across our core annuity sales motions and continuedlong-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger longer-term
Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can driveincreased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, downyear over year primarily driven by the impact of scaling our AIinfrastructure.And now, capital expenditures. We expect Q4 capital expenditures toincrease on a sequential basis. H2 capex in total remains unchanged fromour January H2 guidance. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spendvariability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery offinance leases.Next to segment guidance.In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $32.05 to$32.35 billion, or growth of 11% to 12% in constant currency.M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% inconstant currency, relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Weexpect continued ARPU growth thru E5 and M365 Copilot and some seatgrowth moderation given the size of the installed base.M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid-singledigits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes both theWindows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office
transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in periodrevenue recognition dynamics.M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-teens drivenby the January price increase.For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits.And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to highteens with continued growth across all workloads.For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue of $28.75 to $29.05 billion orgrowth of 20% to 22% in constant currency.Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can havequarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognitiondepending on the mix of contracts.In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be between 34% and 35% inconstant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. Inour non-AI services, we expect focused execution to continue drivinghealthy growth. In our AI services, while we continue to bring datacentercapacity online as planned, demand is growing a bit faster. Therefore, wenow expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.In our on-premises server business, we again expect revenue to decline inthe mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings.
And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be inthe mid to high single digits driven by Enterprise Support Services.In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.35 to $12.85billion.Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid to highsingle digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue to decline in the low tomid-single digits assuming OEM inventory levels come down thru thequarter as noted earlier, although the range of potential outcomes is widerthan normal. Devices revenue should decline in the high teens.Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the highteens, even on a strong prior year comparable. We expect to see continuedgrowth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains acrossEdge and Bing. Overall Search and news advertising revenue growth shouldbe in the mid-teens.And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits.We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the highsingle digits driven by first-party content.Now back to company guidance.We expect COGS of $23.6 to $23.8 billion or growth of 19% to 20% inconstant currency and operating expense of $18 to $18.1 billion or growthof approximately 5% in constant currency. Therefore, even with ongoing AI
investments as we scale, we continue to expect full-year FY25 operatingmargins to be up slightly year over year.Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.2 billionprimarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. Asa reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equitymethod investments.And lastly, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscalyear.We remain committed to investing against the strong demand signals wesee for our services. So, as a reminder, our earlier comments on FY26capital expenditures remain unchanged. We expect capex to grow, it willgrow at a lower rate than FY25 and will include a greater mix of short-livedassets which are more directly correlated to revenue than long-lived assets.These investments, along with focused execution that delivers near termvalue to our customers, will ensure we continue to lead through the cloudand AI opportunity ahead.With that, let’s go to Q&A, Jonathan.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out ofrespect for others on the call, we request the participants please only askone question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
(Operator Direction.)KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking thequestion, and congratulations on a fantastic quarter in what all of us arelooking at as a difficult environment, a lot of uncertainty out there, so reallyimpressive to put up the results that you guys did.One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media andpress reports was changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoftwalking away from some of those datacenter commitments. But it soundslike the AI demand is very strong. You’re talking about not being able to hitall that demand with supply. Can you talk to us about what’s going on withyour datacenter strategy? Are there any shifts taking place?And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the commentsthat you had made about the potential risk for oversupplies and GPUs outin the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about? And areyou incorporating that risk into your datacenter strategy?SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the questions. Thereality is, we’ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pacewe build, all through the last 10-15 years. It’s just that you all pay a lot moreattention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays.Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds and lease bepositioned for what is the workload growth of the future. That’s what youhave to go and seek to. There’s a demand part to it. There is the shape of
the workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. You don’t want tobe upside-down on having one big data center in one region, when youhave a global demand footprint. You don’t want to be upside-down whenthe shape of demand changes, because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute, that’s a big change in terms of how youthink about even what is training. Forget inferencing.Fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there’s great Moore’sLaw, but remember, this is a compounding S-curve, which is, there’sMoore’s Law, there’s system software, there’s model architecture changes,there’s the app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make surewe’re building, accounting for the latest and greatest information we haveon all of that.And that’s what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about thepace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so,therefore, but it’s not power. It’s not a blanket statement. I need power inspecific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which wewant. And so, that’s the plan that we’re executing.Maybe, Amy, you can add to that.AMY HOOD: Yeah, maybe just to add a little bit to Satya’s comments, just areminder, these are very long lead time decisions. From land to build tobuildouts can be lead times of five to seven years, two to three years. We’re
constantly in a balancing position as we watch demand curves and many ofthings Satya watched.And the second part is just to maybe remind you, when Satya talks aboutbeing short power, he’s really talking about data center space. And so,we’ve continued through the second half to put things in place. In fact, wetalked a little bit about pulling even some of that space to be ready earlierand being able to deliver that earlier to customers this quarter, which isreally good work by the teams, as we continue to get more and moreefficient at that process. And I look forward to being able to continue to dothat in the future.I did talk about in my comments, we had hoped to be in balance by the endof Q4. We did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter.We are going to be a little short, still, a little tight as we exit the year, butare encouraged by that.KEITH WEISS: Excellent. Thank you, guys.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. Satya, on your comment aboutaccelerating demand for cloud migrations, I’m curious if you could dig inand extrapolate a little more what you’re seeing there. Thank you.
SATYA NADELLA: Thanks, Brent. Yeah, I sort of think about three bigthings that are happening in the cloud, all at parallel, and there is also arelationship between them. One is, I’ll just say, the classic migration ofwhether it’s SQL, Windows Server. And so, that’s, again, got good steadystate progress, because the reality is, I think everyone’s now, perhapsthere’s another kick in the datacenter migrations, just because of theefficiency the cloud provides. That’s one part.The second piece is good data growth. You saw Postgres on Azure. I mean,forgetting SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing. Cosmos is growing,the analytic stuff I talked about with Fabric. It’s even the others, whether itis Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. We feel very goodabout Fabric growth and our data growth.Then the cloud-native growth, this is, again, before we even get to AI, someof the core compute consumption of cloud-native players is also veryhealthy. It was healthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go movingforward as well.Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we’ve mentioned thismultiple times before. If you look underneath even ChatGPT, in fact, thatteam does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in termsof AI accelerators they need. They use Cosmos DB. They use Postgres. Theyuse core compute and storage. And so, there’s even a ratio between any AIworkload in terms of AI accelerator to others.
Those are the four pockets, I would say, or four different trend lines, whichall have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and Italk a lot about this, this time around, there’s nothing certain for sure in thefuture, except for one thing, which is our largest business is ourinfrastructure business. And the good news here is the next big platformshift builds on that. It’s not a complete rebuild, having gone through someof these platform shift, where you have to come out on the other side witha full rebuild.If there is good news here, it’s that we have a good business in Azure thatcontinues to grow, and the new platform depends on that. We want to staydisciplined and execute super well on that.BRENT THILL: Thank you.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much for taking myquestion, and I will reiterate what my peers have said. Congratulations onthe great quarter.Satya and Amy, Microsoft is a very different business than it was during thelast recession. Incredible job you’ve done. If we get into a recession, and Ihope we don’t, how do you think about the stability, the sustainability,revenue volatility of Microsoft today, if we were to get into recession?
Would the business react early to recession or late? Would a recession havea more shallow impact on revenue? Any thoughts would be appreciated.SATYA NADELLA: Maybe I’ll start and then Amy should add, Mark. Theway, at least, I think we will approach it is, quite frankly, be very focused onhow we help our customers if there is any turbulence in the macro, becauseone of the things that we feel we can do, just because of the efficiencies ofthe cloud, and the footprint we have and the differentiated layers of thestack, from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side, I think if youbuy into the argument that software is the most malleable resource wehave to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growthpressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be superhelpful in that.And so, if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset, is howdo we make sure we are helping our customers? And then, of course, we’lllook to share gains.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, thanks. A number of metrics to applaud, butI think the one that stands out to me is the 16 point a growth rate lift toAzure from AI.
Satya and Amy, I just wanted to ask if you could unpack that a little bit. Ofcourse, you mentioned that you got a bit of a kicker from capacity comingonline. But I’m a little bit more interested in where the demand came inabove expectations, like what workload type. It’s hard for us to see that onthe outside. Was it a surge in ChatGPT inference that landed in Azure? Wasit an uptick in enterprise AI adoption? And Amy, do you think that 16 pointscould be higher in June? Thank you.AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl, for the question. Just to provide some clarity,because I think your question implies something that we didn’t mean toimply on the call. First, the real outperformance in Azure this quarter was inour non-AI business. Then to talk about the AI business, really what wasbetter was precisely what we said. We talked about this. We knew Q3 thatwe had really matched supply and demand pretty carefully, and so didn’texpect to do much better than we had guided to on the AI side. We’vebeen quite consistent on that.The only real up side we saw on the AI side of the business was that wewere able to deliver supply early to a number of customers. And being ableto do that throughout the quarter creates quite a good benefit to us. Butthe majority of our outperformance versus where we had expected to bewas on the non-AI piece of the business.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)
KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you very much. One questionfor Amy.You’ve said in the past that that you can attain better and better capitalefficiency with the Cloud business, and probably Cloud and AI business.Where do you stand today, Amy? Maybe, Satya, you can opine as well, thatyou’ve said before, that you can slow down your CapEx growth rate, whilestill accelerate Azure, which includes AI. Can we get a market to market onthat? Thank you.AMY HOOD: Maybe I’ll start, Kash, and let Satya add on, because I reallythink when you go back and read some of Satya’s comments on how the S-curves build on themselves, that’s actually the levers that go in to theanswer of the question that you’re asking.And so, the way, of course, you’ve seen that historically is right when wewent through the prior cloud transitions, you see CapEx accelerate. Youbuild out datacenter footprints. You slowly fill CPU capacity. And over time,you see software efficiencies and hardware efficiencies build on themselves.And you saw that process for us, for, goodness, now, quite a long time. Andwhat Satya’s talking about is how quickly that’s happening on the AI side ofthe business, and you add to that model diversity. Think about the samelevers, plus model efficiency, those compound.Now, the one thing that’s a little different this time is just the pace. And so,when you’re seeing that happen, pace in terms of efficiency time, but also
pace in terms of the buildout, so it can mask some of the progress. But weare working hard across all of the teams, hardware, software, even the buildteams, to get things in place as quickly as possible, dock to live times. All ofthat is improving, and all of that actually is benefiting us.And I’ll go ahead and say our margins on the AI side of the business arebetter than they were at this point, by far than when we went through thesame transition in the server to cloud transition.SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I mean, I think at a macro level, I think the way tothink about this is, you can ask the question, what’s the difference betweena hosting business and a hyperscale business? It’s software. That’s, I think,the gist of it. Yes, for sure, it’s a capital intensive business, but capitalefficiency comes from that system wide software optimization. And that’swhat makes the hyperscale business attractive, and that’s what we want tojust keep executing super well on.KASH RANGAN: Super, Thanks so much.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you so much. Satya, you hadcommented recently that the DeepSeek moment is a real thing, and youhad said that software efficiencies mean that the fleet will be aged for a
longer time. Can you comment on how those advances are affecting thepace and volume of AI experimentation and activity in the marketplace?And Amy, could we start to consider the possibility that softwareenhancements might extend the useful life assumption that you’re using forGPUs, or is it a little premature to be thinking that way?SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. First of all, I think some of the work that actually,OpenAI first pioneered and did with all of the reasoning models, and ofcourse, DeepSeek has added to it and done good work as well, and othersas well, the idea that you can have test time compute plus pre-training, andthen some of the great optimization at inference time that has allhappened has proven out.I mean, if you look at it, I would say for every Moore’s Law change andmovement, there’s probably a 10x improvement because of software. That’swhat’s happening with these models. Some of it comes from modelarchitecture. Some of that comes from data efficiency, compute efficiency,and what have you.That’s what we are riding, and we feel that, all up, when you have acommodity that is getting that better, then the question is, how do youbuild out a fleet that’s super balanced, so that then the workloads can bebuilt and can, in fact, take advantage of that efficiency at the underlyinginfrastructure?
I mean, it’s kind of like virtualization. What is the difference between serversand, again, client server with virtualization? It was efficiency. What is thedifference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency. What is thedifference between this generation of cloud and AI? It’s efficiency. Themore you can kind of continue to think about software driving thatefficiency is what drives demand, ultimately.AMY HOOD: And to your specific question, in terms of thinking about thedepreciable life of an asset, we like to have a long history before we makeany of those changes. We’re focused on getting every bit of useful life wecan, of course, out of assets. But, to Satya’s point, that tends to be asoftware question more than a hardware one.MARK MURPHY: Thank you.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.(Operator Direction.)KIRK MATERNE, Evercore ISI: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on agreat quarter. Amy, you mentioned that the upside in Azure came from thenon-AI services this time around. I was wondering if you could just talk alittle bit more about that. And I guess as you look forward, maybe what’sdifferent this go round versus what we saw a few years ago, when,obviously things like optimization weighed on the growth a little bit? Itsounds like the product portfolio is much broader right now, but justwondering if you could add some color on that front. Thank you.
AMY HOOD: Sure, and thanks for the question, Kirk. We know the non-AI. Italked a little bit about this. In general, we saw better than expectedperformance across our segments, but we saw acceleration in our largestcustomers. We call that the enterprise segment in general. And then inwhat we talked about of our scale notions, where we had some challengesin Q2, things were a little better.And we still have some work to do in our scale notions. And we’reencouraged by our progress. We’re excited to stay focused on that as, ofcourse, we work through the final quarter of our fiscal year.By geo, the performance was pretty consistent. Satya actually highlightedsome of the workloads that came in a little better than we thought.Obviously, just some good, consistent work on migration, good executionby the sales and partner teams, the data workloads he went through.And so, in general, Kirk, I wouldn’t say it’s anything beyond that. I do thinkit was improved execution. And I was happy to see it, but there’s still somework to do on our scale motions in particular.KIRK MATERNE: Thank you.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Kirk. Operator, we have time for one lastquestion.(Operator Direction.)
ALEX ZUKIN, Wolfe Research: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in, andagain, just amazing. Congratulations on those Azure numbers, which I thinkare, quite honestly, just inspiring.Maybe, Amy, to the point that you’re making that the surprise factor was onthe non- AI side of the house, and it sounds like there’s confidence in thatcontinuing beyond. How much of that are you starting to see the pull in ofthe non-AI driven by the AI portion of Azure? And on the AI portion,specifically, as test time compute really just blows out kind of priorconceptions of scaling law challenges, how much does that change,potentially, the curve of the AI Azure growth as you go forward here overthe next few quarters?AMY HOOD: Thanks, Alex. Let me, first of all, say I think we’ve talked aboutthis quite a bit. It’s always a good chance to get to iterate this.It’s getting harder and harder to separate what an AI workload is from anon-AI workload. And we’ve talked about it this way, I think, in mostinstances, to make sure people understood that when we were acceleratingall of our CapEx spend over the past two and a half or three years now, thatpeople had confidence that we were turning that into revenue and productin a way that was transparent and that everyone could understand, reallythe goals that we had set for ourselves and for our partners and customersin terms of building product that turned to revenue.
But if you take a step back from that, it’s that these workloads are beingbuilt, GPUs, CPUs, storage, network, all the same things. And so, I thinkreally what we’re talking about is really how Satya talked about, in one ofthe earlier questions, we’re seeing digital natives. Digital natives buildworkloads. They do AI work. They do non-AI work. Do they tend to do thatwork in the same cloud? Lots of times. Sometimes it’s all in the same place,not all the time. But that relationship gets stronger and stronger as peoplepivot to more of AI heavy workloads.And so, I think you’re starting to see some of that relationship. I think we’llcontinue to see that as AI workloads continue to get built andexperimented with, and proof of concepts get expanded. And so, I think Imostly focus on the fact that together, we saw good performance in Q3 onAzure, Azure inclusive of both components, in terms of our execution, interms of the field and partner teams, and backlog and conversion, andinteresting workloads, and adding customer value, and solving realproblems, and adding real value.And I think that’s probably, Alex, how I would approach that number, morethan trying to separate it in the way that even we have talked about it, butfor very different reasons.JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion oftoday’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forwardto speaking with you all soon.
SATYA NADELLA: Thank you.AMY HOOD: Thank you.(Operator Direction.)END
