Workday, Inc.
First Quarter Fiscal 2026
Prepared Remarks
May 22, 2025
Introduction
Welcome to Workday’s first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings conference call. On the call we have
Carl Eschenbach, our CEO, Zane Rowe, our CFO, and Gerrit Kazmaier, our President, Product
& Technology. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was
issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being
simultaneously webcast.
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call,
particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today, and include
forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand,
operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release
and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
including our fiscal 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in such statements.
In addition, during today’s call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe
are useful as supplemental measures of Workday’s performance. These non-GAAP measures
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results.
You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including
reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor
presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website.
The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website
under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, the transcript of this call and our quarterly
investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call.

Our second quarter fiscal 2026 quiet period begins on July 15th, 2025. Unless otherwise stated,
all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal
2025.
With that, I will hand the call over to Carl.
CEO Remarks
Thanks, Justin. And hello to everyone joining us on our call today.
I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered a solid first quarter. We drove 13% subscription
revenue growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%. This performance was fueled by
strong customer adoption across key verticals, geographies, and customer segments.
We all know the economic environment remains a bit uncertain, but I'm incredibly proud of how
our teams are staying focused on our customers' success, and THAT is driving our results.
Workday’s value proposition remains highly relevant in today’s market. The CEOs I meet have
three key priorities: they want to drive efficiencies, they need to be agile in response to market
shifts, and they want to unlock growth with innovation. And from our perspective, they’re turning
to Workday for all three.
We help manage and optimize their most critical assets—that is their people and money— on
one platform with AI at the core. This unified approach reduces total cost of ownership and
helps them move faster, with greater precision.
Our customers trust that Workday’s AI is powered by the largest and cleanest finance and HR
dataset. Our AI is fueled by more than 70 million users under contract and 1 trillion transactions
processed on the platform last year, which gives us a deep understanding of HOW people work.
This enables us to deliver highly differentiated value to our customers. I’ll speak more about that
in a moment. But first, let’s turn to our customer highlights for the first quarter.
In Q1 we established new HCM relationships with United Airlines, Pilot Travel Centers, and
Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company. And it was another strong quarter of expansions with
customers such as FedEx, CVS Health, ASDA stores and Chipotle.
3
Our investment in Financials continues to pay off, with solid growth in both net new ACV and
customers. More than 30% of our net new wins this quarter were once again full suite, and in
our focus industries of SLED and healthcare it was more than 50%. We also had some strategic
Financials go-lives this quarter, including BJ’s Restaurants, Essentia Health, and Genesys
Cloud Services.
Our AI innovation continues to gain traction—new ACV across our AI products more than
doubled year over year in Q1. And roughly 25% of our customer expansions in the quarter
included one or more of these products, such as Recruiting Agent, Talent Mobility Agent, Evisort
and ExtendPro. Fantastic companies including Visa, LabCorp, and Aon all selected our AI
products.
I’m also excited about the momentum we’re building with the office of the CIO. We’re driving
increasing demand for ExtendPro, which enables our customers to build AI applications on top
of our platform. This continues to be one of our fastest growing products, and it’s amplifying
innovation for our customers.
While Workday serves more than 60% of the FORTUNE 500, 75% of our customers have fewer
than 3,500 employees, and we see a significant growth opportunity in the emerging and medium
enterprise market.
In Q1, we launched WorkdayGO specifically for these companies. It gets them up and running
on our enterprise-grade platform fast—we’re talking implementations in as little as 30 to 60 days
with pre-configured deployment. And it's not just the software. They get the full support of our
partner ecosystem and a clear, fixed pricing model. It really moved the needle for us in Q1,
helping our emerging and medium enterprise teams deliver a strong quarter.
Now, let’s talk about industries. I’m excited to share that we now have five industries exceeding
$1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Manufacturing and Tech and Media — two industries that
had a solid quarter in Q1 — recently reached this milestone. They join our three other billiondollar industries: Financial Services, Retail and Hospitality, and Professional and Business
Services. Like I’ve mentioned many times, this shows the strength and diversity of our
business.

Our focus on the Federal sector continues to pay off. We are building a foundation for long-term
growth in this market. This was clear in the huge success of our third annual Federal Forum.
Attendance was up 65% at this year’s event, and we had some great conversations with senior
government leaders about the critical need for transforming the federal workforce, especially in
key areas such as AI, security, and skills.
We’re also very proud of our leadership in Higher Education. We were just named a leader in
the first-ever Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Higher Education Student Information Systems
Software as a Service1
. In Q1 we were thrilled to welcome Centre College, Bow Valley College,
and Gannon University as new customers. And we’re seeing great success with Workday
Student go-lives, including the University of Arkansas System, which is now fully live at 14
institutions across the entire state.
In an environment where everyone is trying to do more with less, Workday gives our customers
the ultimate advantage. AI is built directly into our platform and it’s always on, greater than 60%
of our customers already leveraging Workday Illuminate AI. We’re excited by the adoption we’re
seeing, but we’re even more excited about the strong ROI our customers are getting from our AI
solutions.
Look at Western Union, a longtime Evisort customer. Using Evisort’s AI powered contract
management solution, which was made available through Workday in Q1, they were able to
process contracts 65% faster, while reducing associated outside legal spend by almost 70%.
Just incredible results! The Evisort team had a fantastic Q1 - and they’re just getting started.
Customers are clearly willing to pay for these types of results, which opens up significant new AI
monetization opportunities to help fuel our long-term growth and set us apart from the
competition.
When we look at our roadmap, our focus is on delivering innovations that drive meaningful ROI
for our customers. In fact, our Agents must meet specific TCO, or total cost of ownership
requirements with our early adopter customers before we even bring them to market.
Just this week, we announced a wave of new AI Agents that harness the power of our
unmatched dataset to help amplify talent potential, reduce costs, accelerate decision-making,
and mitigate risk.
5
And to keep us at the forefront of AI innovation, we're really excited to welcome Peter Bailis as
our new Chief Technology Officer. Peter will lead our AI and ML initiatives, driving our vision
forward. With his background at Stanford and Google Cloud, he has a proven track record of AI
innovation at scale, and I couldn’t be more excited he chose Workday.
Partners continue to be a critical driver of our success – extending the power of our platform,
fueling pipeline growth, and bringing new innovations to our customers. In Q1, we once again
saw great contributions from our partners—with more than 20% of our net new ACV in the
quarter coming from partner-sourced pipeline.
Partners are also critical in helping us expand into new markets and meet the diverse needs of
our global customers. In Q1 we signed our first volume Managed Service Provider partnership
with The Mutual Group (TMG) to serve the mutual insurance industry. Additionally, our Global
Payroll Connect program now supports payroll delivery in 187 countries and territories, thanks
to 29 partners building integrations. And through our partnership with Strada, our customers can
manage up to 60 global payrolls all under a single Workday contract.
On the innovation front, we’re seeing strong momentum in our “Built on Workday” program. In
Q1 alone, we added 25 new partner apps to the Workday Marketplace.
Our community of customer and partner developers has nearly doubled over the past year–a
testament to the power of building on the Workday platform. And in just two weeks we'll host
thousands of them at our developer conference, Devcon, in Las Vegas.
Our investments in our global strategy are helping us better serve our existing customers,
attract new ones and make our operations even more efficient. In Q1, we saw solid growth
across EMEA, Asia Pacific and Japan.
In EMEA, we had notable net new wins with Opella Healthcare and global manufacturer Georg
Fischer and we expanded with semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML, and insurance
provider Aviva. We also had a major Financials expansion with Decathlon, as this relationship
continues to grow.
6
As part of our ongoing investment in the U.K., we went live on the AWS U.K. public cloud,
making it possible for customers to access Workday solutions locally. We also announced a
new location for our EMEA headquarters in Dublin, which will bring our local workforce of more
than 2,000 employees together.
APAC had a strong start too, with wins at Swinburne University of Technology, the University of
Melbourne in Australia, Collins Foods and PPL Pharma.
And finally, Japan kicked off the year with new wins at Mitsubishi Motors, TEPCO, and Rigaku.
In Q1, we saw the diversity and durability of our business firsthand, with multiple levers driving
long-term growth.
Looking ahead, we’re staying close to our customers as they navigate the macro environment.
No company is immune to these challenges, and we’re watching it across particular markets
such as SLED and our international business. That said, we’ve got a compelling value
proposition and our teams are focused on controlling what we can - and that is to deliver
innovation and strong ROI for our customers.
The future of work has evolved. During the pandemic, it was about where people worked and
how they collaborated. Today, it’s about how humans and AI agents work together – and how
companies manage the human and digital workforce as one.
I believe no company is better positioned than Workday to lead this shift. With our expertise, our
unparalleled data, and a platform built with AI at its core, we’re ready to shape the future of
work.
I want to give a heartfelt thank you to our customers for their continued trust in Workday, to our
incredible partners, and especially to our Workmates around the world. Your hard work and
commitment gave us such a solid start to the year – and I couldn’t be more grateful.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Zane.

CFO Remarks
Thanks Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today’s call. Our solid Q1 results highlight
the ongoing progress across our strategic growth areas, and the continued efficiencies we are
driving throughout the business.
Turning to results, subscription revenue in the first quarter was $2.059 billion, up 13%, or 15%
when adjusting for the leap year compare. Professional services revenue was $181 million,
resulting in total revenue of $2.240 billion, growth of 13%.
From a geographic perspective, U.S. revenue in Q1 totaled $1.68 billion, up 13%, and
international revenue totaled $559 million, also up 13%.
12-month subscription revenue backlog, or cRPO, was $7.63 billion at the end of Q1, increasing
15.6%. This includes approximately half-a-point of growth from subscription contracts related to
implementation and testing environments, which we refer to as tenants. While these short-term
contracts have and continue to be part of our subscription revenue, we are now including them
in cRPO as they have grown with the business.
Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $24.62 billion, up 19%, and
gross revenue retention rates remained a strong at 98%.
Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $677 million, representing a non-GAAP
operating margin of 30.2%. The outperformance versus guidance was the result of moderated
headcount growth, along with revenue outperformance. GAAP operating income in the quarter
of $39 million was impacted by a $166 million charge related to the restructuring which occurred
earlier in the year.
Q1 operating cash flow was $457 million, growth of 23%.
We repurchased $293 million dollars of our shares during the quarter and had $509 million in
remaining authorization as of April 30. In addition, our board has approved a new $1 billion open
ended buyback authorization.
8
We ended the quarter with $8 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Our current headcount, which incorporates the previously announced restructuring, stands at
approximately 19,300.
Now turning to guidance. Our Q1 subscription revenue performance, and progress across the
key initiatives Carl highlighted earlier, positions us well for the year and we are reiterating our
subscription revenue guidance of $8.8 billion. Our outlook benefits from our diverse set of
opportunities, and the important role that our platform plays across our customer base and
partner ecosystem. While there is heightened macro uncertainty - particularly across certain
markets and verticals - we haven't seen this meaningfully impact our business and our growth
prospects. Though it’s early in the year and the environment remains fluid, we remain focused
on execution and our strategic initiatives.
We anticipate Q2 FY26 subscription revenue to be approximately $2.160 billion, growth of 13%.
We continue to expect a slightly faster pace of subscription revenue growth in the second half of
the year - particularly in Q4 - driven in part by revenue from product deliverables associated with
previously closed deals.
We expect cRPO to increase between 15% and 16% in Q2. This includes approximately a point
of growth from the previously discussed tenant contracts. We expect a similar quarterly impact
of approximately one percentage point to cRPO growth for the remainder of the year.
We continue to expect FY26 professional services revenue of approximately $700 million. For
Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $180 million.
We expect FY26 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28.5%. This outlook accounts
for the Q1 outperformance, along with continued investments across key growth areas including
AI, our partner ecosystem, and targeted international markets. In addition, it includes our
ongoing efforts on growing efficiently. We continue to position the business to drive long-term
growth AND margin expansion.
For Q2, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%.
9
We expect GAAP operating margins to be approximately 20 and 21 points lower than our Q2
and full-year FY26 non-GAAP operating margins, respectively.
The FY26 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%.
We are maintaining our FY26 operating cash flow outlook of $2.75 billion, and we continue to
expect FY26 capital expenditures of approximately $250 million.
Entering Q2, our teams remain dedicated to delivering value to our customers, driving
innovation, and strategically investing in our key growth areas to deliver on our medium and
long-term objectives.
With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.
